# DITAP Accessibility Statement
The Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training Program (DITAP) is committed to providing an inclusive and accessible experience to all participants, including individuals with disabilities. This GitHub repository is managed by the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and is guided by Section 508 compliance to ensure all people with disabilities have full and equal opportunity to access and benefit from the DITAP Curriculum.

## Optimal Experience
GitHub is best used with the latest version of common web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. In recent years, GitHub has done considerable work on improving their accessibility, including launching this accessibility sub-site.  The site is designed to be compatible with common assistive technologies including screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver), speech recognition software, and alternative input devices. If you encounter errors with GitHub, there are opportunities to report them in their Community Discussions. 

## Accessibility Standards Target

This repository is compliant with the WCAG version 2.0 AA standard. 
In addition to the core information found within this repository, additional third-party resources have been provided for supplemental learning. While this project has worked to provide the best accessibility for these sources, we cannot fully guarantee accessibly standards for this additional content, as they are owned and managed by other organizations.

### Automated Testing

We recommend using automated tools to check for accessibility issues. These tools do not catch everything, but they help create a strong foundation. Tools like **Pa11y** and **Textlint** can fix common problems. Setting up a good CI/CD pipeline will help stop errors before they get added to the repository.

### Plain Language

Writing in plain language is important for accessibility. We encourage authors to visit [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) to learn about best practices. Tools like [HemingwayApp](https://hemingwayapp.com/)  can help identify overly complex sentences, unwieldy grammar, and can identify what grade-level the content appeals to. We suggest checking content both manually and with plain-language evaluation tools. We aim for a Grade 8 reading level. Even though our audience is highly educated, everyone understands information better when it is clear and simple.

### Document Testing

Authors should the tools available to them to check document accessibility. [Visit Section508.gov for tips](https://www.section508.gov/create/). Use the built-in accessibility checker in Microsoft Office to catch problems. For Google Workspace documents, use **GrackleDoc** to find similar issues.

Authors should also make documents easy to follow. Use slides with one heading and one main point. These are easier to read than slides with too much content.

If we publish a document as a PDF, we will also include an editable version in Microsoft Office. This will make it easier to update and improve the document in the future.

## Legacy and Contributed Content

The repository includes older and contributed materials. These materials are useful for students, but they may not meet accessibility standards.

## Support and Feedback
As an open-source resource, DITAP is committed to continuous improvements that ensure the best standards of Section 508 compliance are followed. If you would like to provide feedback or otherwise need assistance using our curriculum, we invite you to create a new issue or submit a pull request.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement
This statement was prepared on 8.18.25. 
This resource was last tested on 8.18.25. The test was carried out by CivicActions
Our team has been testing accessibility throughout the development process. Most of the content was developed in Markdown to minimize the accessibility issues that can come with a more flexible WYSIWYG or HTML editor.  We have used a combination of automated and manual tests to evaluate that we are meeting and exceeding the requirements of Section 508.
