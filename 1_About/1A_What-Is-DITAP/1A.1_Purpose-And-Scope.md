# Purpose and Scope

## What is DITAP? 

DITAP is a training program that teaches federal procurement officers how to effectively buy digital services and technology. It includes educational materials, best practices, and a process for keeping content current through community contributions.

## Why does it matter? 

Federal agencies allocate billions of dollars annually to the acquisition of digital services. However, many procurement professionals lack the specialized expertise required to effectively procure modern technology. This gap in knowledge results in significant challenges, including inefficient use of taxpayer resources, unsuccessful projects, and digital services that fail to meet the needs of the public.

DITAP addresses this critical gap by:

* Reducing acquisition risk through training on emerging technologies like AI and open source  
* Improving taxpayer value by teaching strategies that deliver better outcomes at lower costs  
* Accelerating digital transformation by building a skilled workforce capable of leading complex technology purchases  
* Creating lasting expertise through materials that stay current with technology changes

## Program Vision 

The DITAP program transforms how federal agencies buy and deliver digital services. We equip procurement professionals with the skills, mindset, and tools they need to navigate modern acquisition challenges and deliver technology solutions that truly serve the American people.

## Our Mission 

To develop acquisition professionals who can effectively buy technology solutions through user-centered, agile procurement practices that reduce vendor burden and deliver better outcomes.

## How We Work:
