# How To Contribute

## Introduction

We appreciate your interest in contributing to an [open source project of
the U.S. government](https://code.gov/). You are encouraged to submit issues or pull requests directly. Should revisions be needed, you will receive constructive feedback to guide any adjustments. All thoughtful contributions are valued and welcomed.

Anyone can contribute to this project by submitting ideas for course materials to this repository. Keep in mind that anything submitted to this project must be licensed to be in the public domain.

**NOTICE: All content in this repository is in the public domain**

This project is in the public domain within the United States, and copyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). All contributions to this project will be released under the CC0 dedication. By submitting a pull request or issue, you agree to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.

## Contribution Strategy

Github contributions will be managed by the United States DOGE Service (USDS) and advised by the DITAP Consortium. As an open source resource, any member of the general public will be able to suggest changes to the curriculum but the ultimate responsibilty of rejecting or approving those changes will be held by the USDS. As the managing body of this repository, USDS will also be responsible for determining the accuracy, accessibility, and final location of suggested content. Certain individuals within the USDS will be granted the role of ["Admin"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization). These individuals will be able and responsible for approving, denying, or requesting changes to any incoming pull request from the open-source community.

All information from third-party sources should be properly cited and linked. While third-party information is included in this repository, individuals should avoid including any direct content that would violate copyright if fully included in a open-source repostiory. As the repository changes, content redirects may need to be modified following changes to overall information architecture.

## Contribution Workflow

### Add an Issue to the project backlog

The first step to submitting or editing an existing artifact is to create an issue or big ticket describing the problem you are  attempting to solve, and providing details on how you want to address the issue. 

Be clear about describing the problem you are attempting to address, how you plan to address it, and include a link to the pull request related to the ticket.  

By documenting the problem and proposed solution, you are beginning to create critical documentation for the feature or artifact you are submitting. It's important that as  you are writing your ticket description that you use plain language and speak to as broad an audience as is reasonable for the problem you are addressing.


### Bug reporting

If your issue is a bug, please use this format to describe the issue so that the problem can be validated by other contributors:

1. Describe the observed behavior
   
   - As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior, starting with the URL where the problem occurs/exists, any roles/permission access required to access the URL, then list step by step how to replicate the problem.

2. Describe the behavior you expected
   
   - As concisely as possible, describe the behavior you expected to occur.


## Code Workflow and Branching

If  you would like to submit materials for inclusion in this repository, we follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The basic workflow is to:

1. Fork the project
   
2. Check out the `main` branch
   
3. Create a feature branch whose name starts with the issue ID of the ticket documenting the need for your submission.
   
4. Write code and (and any tests needed) for your change
   
5. Ensure that your commit messages include the TicketID for the problem you are attempting to addess. For example: 
   ```
   417: Add initial documentation structure to the /documentation/about folder
   ```
6. From your branch, make a pull request against `usds/ditap-curriculum-update/main`
    
7. Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
    
8. Wait for your change to be pulled into ``usds/ditap-curriculum-update/main``
    
9. Delete your feature branch



### Pull Requests

When creating a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), the following format should structure your request:

- **Problem**
   - Explain the context and why you're making that change.
- **Solution**
   - Describe the modifications you've done.
- **Result**
   - What will change as a result of your pull request? (Note: This section may be unnecessary because it is self-explanatory because of the solution)
 
Other guidelines to follow include:

- Summary
   - Describe what was done, not the result.
   - Use the present tense, active voice, proper capitalization, and omit an ending period. The summary is the title of the request.
   - Prefix the subject with the scope.
     
- Description
   - Describe the modifications you made in your change.
   - The description of the change should be one line, less than 72 characters.
   - Clearly explain the context and why you are requesting a change. (Ex. What is the problem you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be thought of being the motivation for your change.)
     
- Commit Messages
   - Format to a width no greater than 80 columns.
   - Keeping the line width no greater than 80 columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).
     
- Uploaded files
   - Delete any trailing spaces.

  
### Reviewing Pull Requests

When you submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub, it will be [reviewed](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews) by the project
community, and once the changes are approved, your commits will be brought into
a development branch for additional testing. Once the changes are merged, they will
be pushed back to the main branch.

If the issue the pull request is addressing is particularly urgent, the pull request
will be merged directly into the main branch.

## Contributor's Code of Conduct

These guidelines below apply to anyone contributing to the DITAP project and interacting with other community members on communication channels such as mailing lists, learning portal, Slack, Zoom, email, and discussion boards.

- **Accounts and Names:** Pseudonyms and real names are both allowed
  
- **Be Kind:** Being welcoming to new community members is everyone’s responsibility. Show empathy; use welcoming and inclusive language. Critique is encouraged; being mean is not.
  
- **Be On-Topic:** Posts and comments in the Zoom chat should contribute to the discussion. Start new discussions rather than derailing existing ones.
  
- **Be Respectful:** Do not distribute sexually explicit material. Keep swearing to a minimum. Be sensitive to the expectations of a global audience.

- **Be Legal:** Comply with and do not violate United States law (or other applicable law or legal obligations) and encourage others to do the same.
  
- **Respect Privacy**: Respect the privacy of others. Do not distribute private, confidential, or proprietary correspondence or information without permission.
  
- **Minimize Promotion:** Attributing credit, thanking other contributors, and mentioning one’s company are allowed. Direct promotion or advertisement are not, except in specific venues.
  
- **Report Upward:** Please inform the appropriate DITAP facilitators of your discussion venue if you see a violation of the rules. Handling it yourself is more likely to start an argument, and makes it harder for the community manager to track repeat offenders.
  
- **Respect the Moderators:** Do not argue publicly or privately with moderators about their actions. It’s not good for the classroom and DITAP community in any way. If you have trouble with what one moderator has said to you, bring it up with another moderator, or with the cohort point of contact from your agency. 

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
  
- Focusing on what is best for the course and community
  
- Showing empathy towards other cohort and community members
