# Naming Conventions and File Structure
Consistent naming conventions make it easier for individuals to utilize the repository and contribute. To keep the curriculum repository structured and easy to navigate, we use a hierarchical numbering system for naming folders and files. This ensures clarity, consistency, and scalability as the curriculum grows. The following guidelines establish a standard approach to naming files in this resource to maintain clarity and ease of use.

## General Principles

  - **Clarity and Simplicity**: Keep names concise, avoiding unnecessary words or symbols. Repository names should clearly describe the purpose or contents of the project as simply as possible.
  - **Consistency**: Apply the same patterns across all repositories to reduce confusion.
  - **Searchability**: Choose words that make the repository easy to find through search.

## General Rules
  - **Title Case**: Files should be formatted with the first letter capitalized. 
    -Ex. "File Name.md" or "File-Name.md"
  - **File Name**: Include file type when helpful: 
    - Ex. “README.md”
  - **Keep It Short**: Aim for fewer than 30 characters when possible.

## File Hierarchy
  - **Numbers** (1, 2, 3) represent the main **sections** of the repository
    - Ex. “1_About, 2_ Consortium, or 3_Curriculum).
    - Within these sections, a README file should be present to explain the intention of the **section** and its child **subsections**.
  - **Letters** (A, B, C) represent major **subsections** within a **section**.
    - Ex. “1A_What-Is-DITAP, 1B_Contributions-And-Governance, 1C_Research-Artifacts.”
  - **Decimals** (1B.1, 1B.2) represent **specific files** inside a **subsection**. Files should utilize an initial number to preserve an intentional file order in the repository.
    - Ex. "1_File-Name.md", "2_File-Name.md, etc.".
    - If file numbers go above ten, utilize two characters.
      - Ex. "01_File-Name.md, ..., 10_File-Name.md".

This system creates natural groupings and an intentional files order so materials may be located faster. The following demonstrates these naming conventions in action:

### About Section
```
1_About/
├── 1A_What-Is-Ditap/
├── 1B_Contributions-And-Governance/
├── 1C_Research-Artifacts/
│   ├── 1B.1_Reports/
│   └── 1B.2_Templates/
└── 1C_Archived-Documentation/
```
### Consortium Section
```
2_Consortium/
├── 2A_Meeting-Notes/
└── 2B_About-the-Consortium/
```
### Curriculum Section
```
3_Curriculum/
├── 3A_Ditap-Core-Curriculum/
│   └── 1_Vendor-Materials
│   └── Module-0
│   └─── In-Class Materials
│   └─── Self-Paced Materials
├── 3B_Ditap-Adaptation-Curriculum/
│   └── 3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquisitions-Curriculum 
│   └── 3C.1_DITAP-Strategy-For-Executive-Leaders-Curriculum
└── 3C_Archived-Curriculum/
```

## Creating New Content
When adding new content, consider the following:
  1. Identify the appropriate section (1_About, 2_ Consortium, or 3_Curriculum).
  2. Determine the appropriate subsection level.
  3. Use the established numbering and lettering system to ensure proper file order.
  4. Follow Title Case for folder and file names.
  5. Update this guide if new patterns emerge.

When restructuring or reorganizing content, consider the following:
  1. Keep old links working when possible.
  2. Update all references and links.
  3. Document changes in commit messages.
  4. Consider impact on external documentation.
