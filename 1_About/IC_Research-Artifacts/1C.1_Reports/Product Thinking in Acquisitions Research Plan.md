# Product Thinking in Acquisitions DITAP Adaptation Research

Last modified: April 24, 2025


## Background 

The Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP) has played a crucial role in transforming federal procurement practices for the delivery of digital services. Since its creation in 2014, we have observed that the base curriculum hasn't kept pace with changes in the procurement landscape. Our goal for the DITAP Refresh project is to reimagine the curriculum to provide more experiential learning across different learner communities, make structural investments into multiple vendor, open-source learning models that can stay agile and responsive to change, and update the curriculum to be current and future-proof. 

## Research information 

For our research, we are interviewing Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers (FAC-P/PM) and Federal Acquisition Certification Contracting Officerâ€™s Representatives (FAC-COR) professionals who are not necessarily product managers but need to collaborate with or understand product work. Participants are being asked to volunteer for these interviews. Our interviews include five targeted questions, time permitting, and are conducted virtually via Zoom. These questions will be open-ended response questions, and participants will be emailed the questions one day before their interview. Providing them with these questions in advance allows time to prepare their answers and offer thoughtful feedback to us.


### Research goal 

Our goal is that these interviews provide the answers to help us define the minimal viable product (MVP) for our Product Thinking in Acquisitions DITAP adaptation. 

### Interview questions 

1. What are the most challenging aspects of working on a digital acquisition?
2. What information do you have now that you wish you had when you worked on your first acquisition?
3. What are the top three things you think every PM needs to know about the digital acquisition process?
4. What does it mean to you to lead with a product mindset?
5. How do you evaulate demos and collaborate with vendors?

### Method

Participants are interviewed in 30-minute virtual sessions via Zoom. The meetings will be recorded, with participant permission, and a note-taker will be present in each interview. After each interview, participant responses will be recorded and synthesized in a mural, and the final results will be published in a research readout. The interview information will shape the Product Thinking in Acquisitions DITAP adaptation.

### Recruitment and timeline

Participants schedule their virtual interviews using a calendly link sent via email. They will schedule one 30-minute interview and register with their name and email address. One day before their interview, they'll receive an email from the DITAP Refresh team that contains the five questions they'll be asked. The window to schedule interviews opens on April 30, 2025, and closes on May 30, 2025. Participants can reschedule as needed via the calendly link.
