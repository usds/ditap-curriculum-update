## Digital Services – The Who and The What

Welcome to Digital Services – The Who and The What. 

At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to:

- Define digital services.
- Identify key players in the digital services ecosystem. 

### Defining Digital Services

Let’s start with the what. What is meant by digital services? That is, in fact, the question. It cannot be defined by one simple noun or even one simple sentence. To define digital services, we need to ask ourselves more questions: who, what, why, where, and how?

### Digital Service Wheel

Below you will find the Digital Service Wheel.  Each part of this wheel lists more than one answer to each question above, and the answers shown here are just the beginning. This is why defining digital services can be a complex task. 

![Digital Services Wheel with sections for who, what, where, why and how](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/7d812a8b27abe4f39802dfd4ead5afcc8a7dff07/Media/Module%201/digital%20service%20wheel%202.jpg)



The following definition provided by the [Digital Government Strategy](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) captures most of what this wheel displays:

_“Digital services” refers to “the delivery of digital information (data or content) and transactional services (e.g., online forms, benefits applications) across a variety of platforms, devices, and delivery mechanisms (e.g., websites, mobile applications, and social media).” Digital services may be delivered to internal customers, external customers, or both._

## Then and Now: USCIS.gov Use Case

A few decades ago, individuals filing for immigration status in the United States had to complete several tasks, including completing a variety of forms, obtaining medical exams with designated area doctors, locating a field office, scheduling appointments with the field office, and calling to check on case status once filed. The process was confusing and cumbersome. As of 2015, individuals can access my.uscis.gov, and what a difference this makes, saving time and minimizing frustration.

Take a quick look at the [https://my.uscis.gov/](https://my.uscis.gov/) website. Even the home page gives you an idea of how much easier this process has become. Let’s analyze this use case, starting with “the who.”

**Who?**

The Department of Homeland Security U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), wants to provide a digital service for its customers: individuals filing for immigration status in the United States. In a sense, who benefits from or is affected by implementing the digital service?


**What?**

The end user can access information about the process and content, like downloadable forms. The end user can also complete transactions online, like checking case status or scheduling appointments. Those working in USCIS can process the information less burdensomely.


**Why?**

USCIS wants to provide its customers with information and services digitally to minimize time and frustration. This article, "[Why I’m Bringing the U.S. Digital Service to the Department of Homeland Security](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/why-i-m-bringing-the-u-s-digital-service-to-the-department-of-homeland-security-c96437bc017d)," helps explain why.


**Where?**

Because the site is responsive, users can access it from their computers and mobile devices. Check this out.

**How?**

In our online learning module, Digital Services – The How, you’ll learn how the digital service was developed, including development methodologies, technologies, etc.


## Defining Digital Services: Another Take

Let’s consider the definition of digital services differently. Imagine it as a three-layered cake.

![A 3-layered cake with the layers labeled as information layer, presentation layer, and platform layer representing digital services](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/a35fff1d65346dbbf84d2220b3749b3eaf86658a/Media/Module%201/Digital%20Services%20Cake%20updated.png)

We’ve taken some important information from [Digital Government Strategy](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) which explains each layer in a concise manner.

### What is included in the Information Layer? 

- "Content," any unstructured material that agencies or organizations provide online, including Written materials like fact sheets, press releases, and compliance guidance
- Online transactions: benefits applications, purchases, job applications
- Multimedia: photos, video, audio
- Data: structured information, like census and employment data, environmental measurements, activity logs, and structured website content

End users consume a slice of the information layer daily when they look up information and images or complete forms online or on a mobile device.

### What is included in the Presentation Layer?

Delivery mechanisms:

- Web browsers on any device (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone)
- Native mobile apps
- Social media

The presentation layer is a lot like the “Where.” This is where the end user accesses the information and needs to be present to support the information layer.


### What is included in the Platform Layer? 

This is the technical ingredients for the cake. The platform layer is the place where business logic is performed. It makes it all possible and is the foundation for delivering digital services.  Some examples are:


- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Web Services
- Web Content Management Systems


When the digital services “cake” is served to end users, it’s put on a sturdy and stable plate. What does this mean? 

![A 3-layered cake with the layers labeled as information layer, presentation layer, and platform layer representing digital services, sitting on a layer titled security and privacy](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/015395ca895e708cc78106c3637c249ef1b06add/Media/Module%201/Digital%20Services%20Cake%20Security%20and%20Privacy.PNG)

Security, privacy, and data protection must be built into the technology's life cycle to ensure the safe and secure delivery and use. Thus, the layers of digital services rest on a platform of security and privacy.


## Knowledge Check

Let's Check Your Knowledge

You’ve learned about the definition of digital services by looking at a use case and answering the questions: Who? What? Where? Why? and How? We also defined digital services in terms of three layers: information, presentation, and platform.

Let’s check your knowledge on the what, or the definition of digital services, with a short quiz. 

### True or False

 
1. There is no WiFi where I am. That means I cannot access any digital services.

- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False

Explanation: Digital services can be deployed on a mobile phone using your data plan.

2. It sounds like only adults can be end users of digital services since it's for finding important information or filling out forms. 

- [[ ]] True
- [[X]] False

Explanation: As a grade-school student, you could access a teacher’s webpage to find homoework for that day. That’s a digital service! You might also use websites like Study Island or Khan Academy. These are digital services as well. You’re able to access information and complete “transactions” in a digital manner.


## The Digital Services EcoSystem

Now that you’ve learned what digital services are, let’s learn more about __who__ provides digital services to end users. 

### Digital services developers (in house)

When an organization has an in-house team to support the development of digital services, it uses those seasoned product managers, engineers, and UX/UI designers to develop the service. Who’s needed depends on the scope and type of digital service (architects, security pros, testers, deployment engineers).

### Digital services developers (professional service vendors)

When outside help is needed, the organization, private sector, or government sector works with contracting officers to procure support. Contracting officers (like you!) understand how to evaluate third-party technical competency so members of the organization can be paired with vendors who are good at building and delivering effective digital services.  

The multi-disciplinary teams that design and develop digital services could include the following roles: 


![Digital Services hierarchy diagram illustrating the structure of a digital service team. The top section shows two groups: "Developers – In-House" and " Developers – Professional Service Vendors," both connecting to an "Organization (Government or Private Sector)." The organization then connects to "The end user," depicted as a smartphone displaying a digital service interface. Below the developers, a vertical list details team roles which are explained in the next section.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/67d12c0757ca87a3ee720ea433584bce7c142fdc/Media/Module%201/digital%20services%20team.jpg)

- __Product Owner__: his individual represents the organization and is responsible for working with the digital services development team (in-house or vendor). Some roles include prioritizing feature and functionality development, defining acceptance criteria for features, and providing demonstrations and reviews to the organization’s stakeholders. The Product Owner is ultimately accountable for the success of the digital service.

- __Delivery Manager__: This individual orchestrates the digital services team and enables the team to deliver a quality service on time and within budget.

- __Software Developers__ __– Front-End__: This team or individual works closely with the User Experience Designers, specifically interaction designers, to develop the front-end functionality and user interface to support the organization's vision. 
 
- __Software Developers__ __– Back-End__: This team or individual develops the behind-the-scenes functionality to support data capture, data transfer, or other back-end functionality.

- __User Experience Designers__: This team consists of individuals who focus on visual design, interaction design, and user interface design to make things as intuitive as possible. They work with front-end software developers to develop the front-end functionality and user interface to support the organization's vision.

- __Content Development__: This team or individual builds the content and realizes the organization's vision following a digital content strategy. 
 
- __Security__: This team or individual supports the security component of the digital service development from the start and ensures the safe and secure delivery and use of digital services. This includes data protection, security, and privacy.

- __Deployment Engineers__: This team or individual works to automate digital service delivery from the development environment to the test and production environments.

- __Testers__: This team or individual works with the Product Owner to define acceptance criteria for features and with the developers to ensure they meet it. 

### Organization (private sector/government Sector)

The organization (private/commercial or government) has determined that it needs a digital service. In addition to benefiting the end user (ease of use/minimizing frustration), the organization benefits from automated data that the end user enters into the digital service.  

### End user 

The end user is the user who ultimately interacts with and uses the digital service.


## The Digital Services Ecosystem, Part 2

Let’s return to our USCIS use case. The end user (the individual filing for immigration status) would consider the provider of the service to be the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Let’s imagine for a minute that you are the end user.


__What other government agencies (federal, state, or municipal) provide digital services?__

Take a look at these websites and see if they’re familiar to you. Maybe you’ve used them in the past.

- [IRS](http://www.irs.gov/)
- [USA Jobs](https://www.usajobs.gov/)
- [Maryland Department of Transportation](https://www.mdot.maryland.gov/pages/home.aspx)

__What about mobile apps?__

Look how you can find information about and report information to the [City of Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/departments/philly311/) from your mobile device.

![Woman looking at her mobile phone](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/2810af7ee6289c4a0e6fe7a752bee578cdcb9070/Media/Module%201/Woman%20looking%20at%20cell%20phone.png) 

__Do only government agencies (federal, state or municipal) provide digital services?__

Private sector and commercial organizations can also provide digital services to the end user. In fact, in a given day, you might access websites to perform transactions such as: 

![Woman sitting at a computer asking who ordered from a dog bone website, dog with bone sits behind her](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/2810af7ee6289c4a0e6fe7a752bee578cdcb9070/Media/Module%201/comic.1.jpg)
View and pay your bills online.
 ![Cat asking receptionist how to pay vet bill](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/d37b229592a40ba81c1263e6d61e3127b7c47104/Media/Module%201/comic.3.jpg) 
Check the status of a healthcare claim online.
 ![Young boy sitting in front of TV, procrastinating on doing his book report](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/d37b229592a40ba81c1263e6d61e3127b7c47104/Media/Module%201/comic.2.jpg) 
Order new TV services online.

These examples are from the perspective of the end user. The Digital Services Ecosystem involves additional roles that support the delivery of services to the end user.  You can learn about the Digital Service Ecosystem through the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.usds.gov/).

### Multiple Choice

![Cartoon image of two dogs. One dog, sitting on a chair in front of a computer asks "Did you design this website? It is not dog friendly!" The second dog responds, "Well, you know these days it's all about being people friendly." ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/7d812a8b27abe4f39802dfd4ead5afcc8a7dff07/Media/Module%201/Knowledge%20check%20question%20two%20dogs%202.jpg)

Which of the following is being portrayed in the conversation above?

- [[ ]] Software Design
- [[X]] User Experience Design
- [[ ]] Content Development
- [[ ]] Quality Assurance Testing

Explanation: In this humorous portrayal, “people friendly” refers to the User Experience Design. This involves visual design, interaction design, and user interface design to make things as intuitive as possible for the end user. The user experience designers work with the front-end software developers to develop the front-end functionality and user interface to support the vision set forth by the organization.
