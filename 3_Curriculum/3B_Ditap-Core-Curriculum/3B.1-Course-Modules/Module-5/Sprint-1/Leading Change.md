# Module 5 Sprint 1 

## Introduction: Leading Change

In today’s fast-moving government environment, you are uniquely positioned to lead and influence positive change, from refining everyday procurement practices to scaling innovations across agencies. This module is designed to help you understand your personal role in driving change, strengthen your influence and collaboration skills, and develop strategies for continuous improvement and organizational growth.

You’ll move through two focused sprints:

* **Sprint 1: Leading Change as an Individual**  
   Learn how to be an effective change agent by identifying your personal influence strategies, building networks, and engaging stakeholders to support new ideas and approaches.

* **Sprint 2: Leading Organizational Change – Continuous Improvement and Scalable Practices**  
   Explore strategies for staying current with emerging technologies, applying lessons learned from each procurement, and scaling what works across your agency and the broader acquisition community.

Through both sprints, you’ll apply techniques to **create a culture of innovation within your sphere of influence**—one that empowers you and those around you to lead change and guide customers toward the best solutions.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Define what it means to be a change agent and identify your individual change style

* Apply strategies to influence and engage stakeholders effectively

* Build and leverage networks and coalitions to support change efforts

* Describe approaches for staying informed about emerging technologies and evolving practices

* Identify opportunities to scale successful practices across teams or organizations

* Develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within your agency and beyond

* Apply techniques to foster a culture of innovation that enables effective leadership and customer engagement

## Preparing for and Having an Influence Conversation 

Introduction 

You recently practiced influence conversations as a way to engage a variety of stakeholders.

As with most processes and initiatives, work gets accomplished in acquisition as much through networks, the quality and depth of relationships, and the willingness of employees to work productively with each other, as it does through formal authority and roles. 

As you lead change in digital services acquisition (and therefore change in your agency’s acquisition policies and practices), these networks, relationships, and employee commitments are assets you need. 

![An overhead shot of people sitting around a large white circular table, most holding smartphones or tablets.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/influence%20conversation.png)

To meet the contracting needs of your digital services team, you'll be asking your agency to make changes in its procurement practices, how people work together, and the operating tempo of the acquisition lifecycle. 

In this module, you'll revisit how to prepare for an influence conversation by taking a second look at the following steps: 

![An infographic with four steps, each representing a step in an influence conversation. From top to bottom: 1. Identify the Need or Problem for the Influence Conversation. 2. Target the range of influencers who can satisfy the need or help solve the problem. 3. Select those with the greatest leverage. 4. Prepare for the conversation using the Ladder of Inference.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/steps%20for%20influence%20conversation.png)

## Identify the Need or Problem

As you lead a digital services procurement, you'll likely need to accomplish out-of-the ordinary tasks. We’ve discussed how you may need to conduct nontraditional market research, engage with potential contractors at a deeper level, or develop a more iterative acquisition strategy. As you work on these unusual tasks, you'll likely encounter resistance or worse from people who oversee or are involved with the practice you are changing, but who function in roles you cannot control. 

You can anticipate this resistance by understanding what you are working to change and what roles in the process it might affect.   

![A man in a dark suit and blue shirt with a tie sits at a round table, looking down thoughtfully while writing on a piece of paper. ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/man%20thinking.png)

Think of a particular problem, opportunity, or need you have as a digital services acquisition leader. The following are representative examples of challenges you may face in your agencies and live digital assignments: 

* Accelerating cycle time in a particular part of the acquisition lifecycle or procurement process to meet the needs of your Product Owner and particular backlog requirements   
* Gaining relief from a policy that requires an exhaustive and lengthy review process by a Contract Review Board or other oversight group every time the agency considers a new type of procurement or one that's not common practice in your agency   
* Addressing a higher intensity role and increased resource commitments you need CORs and program representatives to play in your digital services procurement   
* Solving the issue of receiving incremental funding across fiscal years instead of one allocation in a given fiscal year or a larger, multi-year program   
* Creating different procurement performance **metrics** and measures based on iteration/release outcomes instead of more standard procurement performance outputs


Have you experienced any of these? 

Take a moment to share a challenge of your own, or feel free to adapt one of the examples above. Post your challenge in the discussion section below, and how you overcame these challenges. 

### Discussion (optional)

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* How can we align our procurement timelines with the rapid development cycles needed for digital products?  
* What specific policy constraints are causing the most significant bottlenecks in our digital acquisition process?  
* How can we better prepare and support our CORs and program representatives to succeed in digital service oversight roles?  
* What alternative funding mechanisms can we explore to support iterative development across fiscal boundaries?  
* How do we measure success in digital service acquisitions differently from traditional procurement?  
* Who are the key stakeholders we need to educate about modern digital practices to gain their support?  
* How can we implement smaller, more frequent procurements rather than large, monolithic contracts?  
* What data do we need to collect to demonstrate the value and efficiency of our digital acquisition approach?  
* How might we create reusable procurement templates to accelerate future digital acquisitions?  
* What lessons can we learn from other agencies that have successfully modernized their acquisition practices?

## Target the Range of Influencers Who Can Satisfy the Need/Help Solve the Problem 

Based on the problem you have selected, identify the range of influencers who can help you address this problem. Refer back to the Stakeholder Analysis Activity to help you get started. In some cases, you may need to reach out to your own network and mentors for help in identifying the influencers who you have some direct or indirect power over. 

![A group of business people stand on a network of interconnected circles, simulating a social or professional network](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/target%20range%20of%20influencers.png)

The following table lists some example challenges you may encounter, along with the potential range of influencers affected by that issue or challenge. These influencers have the potential to either improve your ability to overcome the challenge or prevent you from accomplishing what you need. 

| Potential Issue/Challenge | Potential Range of Influencers |
| :---- | :---- |
| Accelerating cycle time in the procurement process | Head Contracting Authority (HCA) or Procurement Division Lead Policy Office Lead or Representative Senior Contracting Officer Senior Contracting Officer Representative (COR) |
| Gaining relief from a policy that requires a lengthy review process | Senior Procurement Representative, Deputy, or SPE Office Representative Office of General Counsel or Representative Chief Management Officer, Deputy Secretary, or Designee HCA or Representatives Policy Office Lead Representative Acquisition Innovation Advocate |
| Addressing increased role and  resource commitments with  program representatives | Bureau or Office Directors or Designees Product Owner(s) Program Leaders CORs |
| Receiving incremental funding across fiscal years | Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Deputy or Designee HCA, Procurement Division Lead, or Designee SPE or Designee |
| Creating different/agile  procurement performance  measures | Policy Office Lead or Designee SPE, Deputy SPE or Designee Performance Improvement or Strategy Office CMO or Designee  |

Now think about the titles of the influencers in your chosen problem. Who could help, or hinder, your efforts? 

### Discussion (optional)

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* Who are the formal decision-makers at each level of the organization for this digital initiative?  
* Which informal leaders have significant social capital regardless of their position?  
* Who controls resources (budget, personnel, technology) needed for this transformation?  
* Whose day-to-day work will be most directly impacted by these digital changes?  
* Which stakeholders have successfully championed similar initiatives in the past?  
* What are each influencer's primary goals, metrics, and priorities?  
* How can you frame the digital transformation in terms that resonate with each influencer's priorities?  
* Where is resistance most likely to emerge and why?  
* How do formal and informal communication channels operate in this organization?  
* Where do silos exist that might impede cross-functional collaboration?  
* How will this digital transformation affect existing power structures?

 

## Select those with the greatest leverage

After identifying the range of influencers, you need to narrow down your list and choose those with the greatest leverage or impact over your issue or challenge. You may need to turn to your adviser or mentor for assistance in this process.   

![A professional woman in a dark shirt gestures towards a complex network of interconnected circular profile pictures of individuals, appearing to touch one of the connections. The network of faces spreads around her, symbolizing connections and influence.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/leverage.png)

To help you determine who has the greatest leverage in your situation, answer the following questions: 

1. What's the source of the influence the other party has over your issue or challenge?   
2. What power do they have over the process, outcomes, resources, or supporting roles regarding your issue or challenge?   
3. How close or distant is your relationship with them – by function, position, hierarchy – or by some common, shared interest or experience?   
4. Who influences them? What's the web or network of other influencers who play reciprocal roles in this issue or challenge? What's your relationship with these  
   other influencers? What motivates them?  
5. How significant is their influence over your issue or challenge? Is it direct or indirect? 

### Discussion (optional)

Based on your answer to these questions, select the influencer who can most impact your issue or challenge, either negatively or positively. Share below and provide your reasons for why you chose this person. Again, use a title instead of a name. 

## Prepare for the Conversation Using the Ladder of Inference 

![Two businessmen, both wearing suits, are shaking hands and smiling](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/two%20men%20shaking%20hands.png)

Now that you have identified the person of greatest influence for your problem, it's time to plan your conversation with them.   
We each enter a new conversation or new environment with a set of preconceptions or biases. The Ladder of Inference is a tool to understand how we develop and take action on these biases and preconceptions. The Ladder works like this: 

1. At the bottom of the Ladder is observable data or phenomena in the real world.   
2. First rung up from the bottom, we select specific data to focus on.   
3. On the second rung, we interpret the data and create an explanation of what the data means.   
4. On the third rung, we develop theories and beliefs that explain our interpretation.   
5. Finally, we take action based on those theories and beliefs. 

![An image of a blue step ladder on the left, with an upward-pointing blue arrow next to it on the right. Along the arrow, five bullet points are listed from bottom to top, representing the steps of the Ladder of Inference: -Observable data or phenomena, -Focus on specific data, -Interpret the data and explain what it means, -Develop theories and beliefs, -Take action.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/9e11fd265cf81cfb6b797f6045e80a6f8f157447/Media/Module%205/ladder%20of%20inference.png)

You can best prepare for your influence conversation by working to understand the potential Ladders of Inference you and your influencer may be using. 

Let’s look at an example problem:

You have a situation where you need to change the lengthy review process for a new type of contract. A Policy Office Representative is insisting that the lengthy review process needs to be followed. They've experienced procurements that failed because they were trying something new and did not have appropriate oversight. This experience created the interpretation that consistent and rigid oversight is needed in all cases. The Representative has developed a theory that the best way to prevent a similar occurrence is through a Contract Review Board (CRB) process. Therefore, they're insisting that your procurement go through the same process. 

To use the Ladder of Inference, think about how the influencer may arrive at these kinds of conclusions and how you may be able to walk the Ladder of Inference to resolve the issue. In the case of the Policy Office Representative, you may be able to engage them in solving the problem of what kind of oversight could satisfy the same concern without going through a formal CRB. 

To set the meeting with your influencer, reach out directly if you already know each other or are close enough in the organization that you know each other by your roles. If you are not familiar with each other, ask your mentor, adviser, or another contact for an introduction. Finally, you also have the option to reach out directly under the authority of your digital services acquisition role because your agency has committed to your digital services education. 

### Discussion (optional)

Analyze your problem using the Ladder of Inference. Share what each rung would cover and how you can use it to direct the conversation in the discussion below. 

As you think about this topic, consider the following:

* What specific procurement failures led to their conviction about rigid oversight?  
* Which elements of those failed procurements were most problematic?  
* Are there successful procurements with alternative review approaches we can examine?  
* What data might the Representative be filtering out when focusing only on failures?  
* How has the Representative connected "new procurement approaches" with "failure"?  
* What assumptions exist about the similarity between past failed procurements and our current situation?  
* What assumptions underlie the belief that the CRB process is the only effective oversight method?  
* Is there an assumption that all new procurement types carry the same risks?  
* How did the Representative conclude that consistent, rigid oversight is universally beneficial?  
* Has the belief that "innovation in procurement equals risk" become entrenched?

---

Once you have considered the above, consider some strategies to overcome these challenges:

* **Find Common Ground**: Acknowledge the importance of oversight while suggesting tailored approaches for different situations.  
* **Share Success Stories**: Provide examples of successful procurements that used streamlined review processes.  
* **Propose Alternative Oversight**: Develop a modified review process that addresses specific risks without the full CRB burden.  
* **Use Data**: Present metrics on time/resources spent on CRB versus outcomes achieved.  
* **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Invite the Representative to help design an alternative process that addresses their concerns.  
* **Pilot Approach**: Suggest a limited test of a modified review process with specific success metrics.  
* **Risk-Based Assessment**: Propose a framework for matching review intensity to actual risk level of the procurement.  
* **Elevate Agency Goals**: Frame the discussion around how streamlined processes support broader agency mission and service delivery.  
* **Document Safeguards**: Create explicit documentation of how oversight will be maintained in the alternative approach.  
* **Feedback Loop**: Build in checkpoints and feedback mechanisms to demonstrate commitment to learning and improvement.

  

## Transitioning to the Conversation

The next online module will teach you how to survive a difficult conversation by identifying constructive approaches in a conversation, identifying useful tactics to react to problems, and recognizing common topics that can cause misalignment with acquisition strategies and Agile methodology.

## Difficult Conversations

In this module, you will learn about the art of surviving a difficult conversation. You have already practiced preparing for and having influence conversations, but what should you do when the conversation doesn’t go according to plan? Be it delivering bad news or attempting to persuade a peer to support your decision, we all struggle with having difficult conversations that may be out of our comfort zone. 

At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: 

* Identify constructive approaches to hard conversations.   
* Identify useful tactics for how to react to problems.   
* Recognize common topics that contribute to misalignment of acquisition strategies and Agile methodology.

## Why Can Conversations Be Difficult?

![A black and white headshot of Winston Churchill wearing a dark hat and a bow tie.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/640bc6b71dc44f34b09c2be3ab1dcdd429f9de09/Media/Module%205/churchill.png)

“**Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.**”

\-**Winston Churchill** 

As you saw in the classroom sessions, implementing change is not easy; it requires courage and a willingness to both lead and listen, just as Churchill so astutely acknowledges. It requires humility and recognition that we don’t always know the answers—that’s why we must talk to our users ([Digital Services Playbook Play \#1](https://playbook.usds.gov/#play1)!) first and foremost and why we value validated learning over untested assumptions. These tenets all apply when we approach conversations that we expect to be challenging—or perhaps even downright difficult. How do you make these conversations most productive? 

## Preparing for a Difficult Conversation

The first step in navigating difficult conversations and situations in general, is to prepare and strategize. Here are some techniques to help you prepare for a difficult conversation. 

![A hand holding a piece of chalk is drawing a clock face with the hands at almost 12 o'clock on a dark blue chalkboard. Above the clock face, the words 'Time to Think' are written in large, yellow chalk letters](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/640bc6b71dc44f34b09c2be3ab1dcdd429f9de09/Media/Module%205/time%20to%20think.png)


**1\. Reframe** 

The first thing is to not think of it as a difficult conversation that you need to have, but rather frame your approach in a more positive way. Social psychologists have long explored the impact that labels have in influencing people’s behavior—from perpetuating stereotypes to even changing people’s fundamental self-concepts and identities. In this case, don’t label the conversation—or more importantly the person—as difficult. Instead, approach the conversation as though you’re having a constructive conversation about development. Think about your shared goals and the fact that you’re trying to produce better outcomes for you and the person you’re talking to. Leave the combative me vs. them mentality at home. 

![A man wearing glasses, a dark suit, and a tie is seated at a desk, intently typing on a computer keyboard.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/640bc6b71dc44f34b09c2be3ab1dcdd429f9de09/Media/Module%205/man%20at%20computer.png)

**2\. Prepare** 

If someone comes to you with an issue that might lead to a hard conversation, breathe, take a break – get a cup of coffee or get a glass of water. Collect your thoughts. Before you revisit the conversation, jot down a few notes to help you maintain your focus to be simple, clear, direct, and neutral. Be flexible and consider potential responses.

![An overhead shot of three business people at a rectangular table covered with papers](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/640bc6b71dc44f34b09c2be3ab1dcdd429f9de09/Media/Module%205/business%20people%20at%20table%20with%20papers.png)

**3\. Listen Deeply** 

Think back to Churchill’s quote. Truly and actively listening is a courageous act and one that will buy you goodwill with the other person and help you get to the bottom of the issue. Listen for what the problem is, and for what the other person thinks the problem is. If you don’t understand what the problem is, acknowledge that and ask, and make sure neither of you are making assumptions. Show an interest in the person’s feelings that you’re talking to, and look for overlap in your points of view. Problems are complicated. Avoid oversimplification by respecting the problem you’re trying to resolve and the person you’re talking to.  

![A man and a woman in business attire are seated at a table in an office setting. The man on the left is holding up a paper and gesturing with his right hand as he speaks to the woman. The woman on the right is looking at the papers on the table and appears to be speaking or explaining something](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/640bc6b71dc44f34b09c2be3ab1dcdd429f9de09/Media/Module%205/man%20woman%20at%20table.png)

**4\. Deliver Difficult News Directly but Considerately** 

If you have to deliver bad news, be compassionate and considerate but do so in a courageous, honest, and fair way, just as you would want to receive the information if the situation was reversed. Don’t emote or overly emphasize how hard it is to make a difficult delivery (e.g., avoid going on and on with statements like, “This isn’t something I like to do; this is hard news to deliver…”). It takes practice, but you want to be clear, direct, and unemotional. Keep the pace of the conversation slow, which helps to find the right words and reduce any tensions. If the conversation puts the other person in a difficult spot, where you’re taking something away from them, think of what you might be able to give back. For example, if you have to turn down your boss for a work assignment, think of a viable alternative solution that might help them as an option. 

For more information on these techniques, review this [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2015/01/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations-at-work) article.

## What Makes the Conversations Difficult?

In most cases, the conversation will be difficult because the parties involved are not in agreement about the subject matter. One of the best tools you can have to deal with disagreement is empathy. Here is a framework for analyzing the drivers for the difficult conversation: 

### Making Assumptions 

* You can’t know what the other person’s intentions are. They also don’t know what your intentions are.   
* Don’t assume the other person has bad intentions.   
* Don’t assume that because you have good intentions, the other person sees it that way. 

### Blame

* If people think they’re going to be blamed, they’ll be less likely to cooperate and share information.   
* Instead of trying to assign blame, explore how each person contributed to the situation. This will help develop a clearer picture of what happened and aid in making improvements. 

### The other person’s point of view

* Instead of listing all of the reasons why the other person is wrong, imagine what they might be thinking and why.   
* You don’t have to completely accept the other person’s point of view, but you should be interested in learning about it. As Wharton professor and social psychologist Adam Grant explores in his book The Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, asking people with extreme political views how their preferred policies work (i.e., showing interest in learning about their position) actually helps them become more moderate. Asking why they believe a certain way can make them hold onto their beliefs more strongly. However, when asked to reflect, there's evidence to suggest that they are more likely to then realize the complexity of the issues and that there may be middle ground. Consider how to apply this principle with those in your organization with extreme views. 

### Feelings

* Ask yourself why you feel the way you do. This will help you take a more reasonable approach to the situation.   
* Imagine how the other person might feel about things to be prepared for his/her reactions. 

### Self-identity 

* When people’s self-identities are threatened, they usually react strongly. This can make problems hard to resolve.   
* Think about what the conversation says about who you are and how it relates to your self-identity. Also, think about how it relates to the other person’s self identity.   
* Being aware of your vulnerabilities is key to maintaining your balance during a conversation. You don’t want to be surprised by your reactions.   
* Be aware of the role hierarchy plays in people’s self-identities. 

   
## Tips to Navigate the Conversation

As you mentally prepare for a conversation, here are some tips that can help you: 

* Clarify the problem for yourself first.   
* Prepare references to support your recommended solution (e.g. the [FAR](https://www.acquisition.gov/browse/index/far) and [TechFAR](https://playbook.usds.gov/techfar/), [Defense Acquisition System Instruction 5000.02](http://acqnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/DoD-Instruction-5000.02-Operations-of-the-Defense-Acquisition-System-7-Jan-2015.pdf)).   
* Plan to approach the discussion with a sense of exploration and the potential need to bridge understandings from different points of view.   
* Focus on the objective and desired outcome.   
* Practice how to begin the conversation.   
* Present your assessment of the problem, and ask any questions you might have.   
* Listen quietly to the other person, summarize what they’ve said, and validate their reasoning even if you have a different interpretation.   
* Engage in negotiation to resolve how to solve the problem together.   
* Formalize an agreement into a series of commitments and next step action items. 


## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Acquisition

So far, the information presented in this course is great in theory, but what does it look like when it’s applied to your unique digital service acquisition situation? Well, below, you’ll find some common digital service acquisition scenarios where difficult conversations are required. Review each scenario and consider similar situations you’ve encountered or that you expect to encounter as you move into your change ambassador role. 

When considering an iterative development approach, program offices and contracting may believe that acquisition regulations and agency guidance limits the government’s ability to use an Agile, Lean, or DevOps approach. 

In departments and agencies with heavy IT review board processes, a particular sticking point is that Agile does not readily accommodate large capstone events such as Critical Design Review (CDR). However, the programs that have used Agile in software development have found that the FAR and DoD 5000 series regulations have great flexibility and do not preclude the use of Agile. Review the scenario below for an example of this approach in action. 

**Context:** A very specific acquisition issue and sticking point is that Agile methodology does not accommodate large events such as the CDR, which is usually a major, multi day event with many smaller technical meetings leading up to it. The intent of these oversight reviews is to mitigate risk by providing detailed plans on how development will be performed over the next few years. This approach requires a great deal of documentation by the contractor and many technical reviews by the government; the documentation serves as a proxy for direct user feedback in the development process. 

**Observation:** In Agile development, the user, developers, and product managers are engaging directly and frequently about the user requirements and design so the scale and comprehensiveness of a CDR is foreign to Agile development teams. Some experienced Agile providers have accommodated this issue by breaking the typical waterfall-based CDRs into multiple Interim Design Reviews (IDRs), which is an example of the type of “flexibility” in implementing modular contracting or DoD 5000 requirements. These IDRs need to reflect the iterative nature of Agile, and they can be held more frequently and with tighter focus for only a few hours at a time, as opposed to the several days needed for CDRs. The entry and exit criteria for an IDR needs to be dependent on the current iteration, and the results of a combination of all IDRs completed should be functionally equivalent to a CDR using waterfall.

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Knowledge of Agile

Agile methods have been developed and used most extensively in the non government/DoD commercial sector with small- to medium-sized projects. Experience with larger projects has recently started to accumulate in the commercial sector. As a result, few government acquisition professionals and contractors are familiar with the use of Agile or possess the necessary experience to effectively implement it—which is exactly the issue that this program is seeking to address\! Review the write-up below for additional context on this issue. 

**Context:** The acquisition community’s imperfect understanding of Agile might undermine the success of an Agile contractor. Agile is relatively new to the government and has its genesis in the software development community, which is mostly isolated from acquisition concerns. As a result, relatively few acquisition professionals have direct experience with Agile, and Agile-unaware PMO members might insist on the more familiar project documents, oversight process, and metrics that do not fit with Agile. Acquisition professionals may want to include requirement specifications to ensure the contractor be held accountable for delivery and may be uncomfortable with buying sprints of undetermined functionality or code demonstrations in lieu of written proposals. Program managers may like the flexibility to change priorities and less documentation, but may not be prepared for the level and frequency of engagement. 

**Observation:** All government and contractor personnel need to spend the time necessary before contract award to understand what it means to use Agile from all perspectives. The following are examples of such considerations. 

* Which contractual phases can employ Agile?   
* What are the milestone and deliverable details for each phase when using Agile?   
* What contract changes would be needed?   
* What changes to the approach of monitoring development progress will be needed?   
* What type of staff members are needed on both sides (government and contractor)?   
* Which of the FAR, TechFAR, or 5000.02 process formalities will be tailored?

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Organizational Culture

Culture is the customary knowledge, beliefs, behaviors, and traits displayed by an organization. The government is heavily invested in the use of waterfall for acquisition of all equipment and systems, whether they are software intensive or not. As a result, a large segment of the government/DoD acquisition community (and that of long-time contractors, as well) is more comfortable with waterfall and skeptical about using Agile. Review the write-up below for additional context on this issue.

**Context:** The government is heavily invested in the use of waterfall for acquisition in general, and this has been applied to software acquisition as well. While other methods have been used, waterfall and its accompanying precepts are most familiar to most PMOs.   

**Observation:** Moving to Agile is difficult—many of the “old ways” and paradigms need to be modified using a fundamental culture change. Not long ago, the training in the interpretation of software acquisition requirements is skewed toward the waterfall approach. Thus, a PMO employing Agile will need to be trained in Agile concepts.

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Organizational Oversight

Tracking and measuring progress while using Agile in a way that is clear to and trusted by the government is a particular challenge. The metrics applied on past software acquisitions, including the use of the Earned Value Method System (EVMS), do not provide the same benefit compared to the effort collecting for Agile as they do for Waterfall. Agile also does not support the kind of granularity of estimates and task detail that is typically shown across the entire project in an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS). Rather, Agile provides delivered working code so the need for estimates is diminished. 

**Context:** Traditional waterfall provides significant oversight and insight into the implementation details of the program; this method is very structured so that it provides predictability, stability, and high assurance. The execution of Agile is distinctly different from what the Program Management Office (PMO) has seen in the past on programs using waterfall. The control and discipline comes from the Agile team itself rather than from control external to the team, that is project and higher management. As a result, the PMO will see a different way that the development is controlled, executed, and viewed.  

**Observation:** In Agile, a system of program metrics that allows the PMO to have insight into the developer’s priorities and the development progress being made on a day-to day basis will allow the PMO to achieve an optimal balance between insight and oversight.

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: End User Involvement

The close involvement of end users in the development process, reviews, and demonstrations, upon which successful Agile implementations depend, is extremely difficult to achieve with the many stakeholders typical of government acquisitions. In addition, the continuous availability of the end user is an issue in the government environment, as end users are usually in operational not acquisition organizations. Acquisition personnel tend to be isolated in acquisition organizations, rather than integrated into operational units.  

**Context:** One of the fundamental principles cited in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) is customer collaboration. In other words, Agile believes close interaction between the developers and end users is important. A basic Agile principle is “business people (users) and developers work together daily,” but in the government acquisition environment, this is rarely easy and may sometimes not even be possible. Government acquisitions involve many stakeholders with inherently conflicting needs. It is hard to get a single viewpoint from the customer because no one person truly represents the users. Plus, it is hard to get all the stakeholders involved in development decisions. 

**Observation:** From program interviews, it was found:   A single voice for the user/customer is essential. This could be accomplished through an input-filtering steering committee that documents decisions, insists that the user community speaks with one voice to the Agile developer (through requirements definition), and receives input from and gives direction to a single person representing the Agile developer. True users (not just PMO representatives) must attend demonstrations that are given specifically to get user information and feedback. A hybrid approach (something between “pure Agile” and FAR/DoD 5000 traditional methods) is needed for large systems to assure that agreements with multiple users are documented, external interfaces are documented and agreed to, and multiple contractual and programmatic constraints are honored. A strong emphasis on government/user participation in reviews and demonstrations is essential. These reviews and demonstrations will be of shorter duration and have a tighter focus with Agile, and this will result in more frequent reviews that reflect the nature of Agile development. For example, having eight two hour reviews spread over time, as opposed to a single two-day event to cover the same material, would be one way to handle this.

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Integration and Test

Because integration and testing activities are part of Agile development iterations, the approach to these activities might significantly change from those used in waterfall. The biggest change is that integration and test needs to be done throughout the project as opposed to waiting until the end of the release cycle. This is another particularly challenging issue of culture change since, historically, integration and test organizations have been outside the development teams once you get beyond unit testing. 

**Context:** Test and integration are incorporated throughout the iteration life cycle used within Agile as opposed to waterfall, which puts it at the end. Testing can have a significantly different role in the project depending on which Agile method is used. The big advantage in Agile testing and integration is that testing can, and usually is, started earlier because of the short timeframes for iterations; this flushes out problems more quickly. Furthermore, gathering customer feedback during the development phase (in each iteration) provides an early look at the code capabilities and helps reduce risk at the time of system integration. 

**Observation:** From program interviews, it was found: 

* Within the government, “sell-off” is the process used by the contractor to obtain formal acceptance of the developed product from the government, thus the government takes ownership as the contractor “sells off.” The nature of “system sell-off” from the contractor’s perspective is still the same as in waterfall; there might be fewer risks because the government is buying smaller allotments of working code through frequent interactions among all parties during the demonstrations.   
* Software builds are completed much earlier with Agile since each iteration produces a usable build; because of this, more frequent test and integration work can be done.   
* The government test community can (and should) be involved early.   
* A lesson specific to integration is that the software integrators need to have access to the ultimate target environment. This reduces issues for the development teams when they get to system-level integration. (The degree to which this is an advantage depends on the target environment and the number of platforms that are involved.)   
* Access to the developers for the testing/integration team can be an issue because of the short (typically two-week) development cycles; this puts intense time pressure on the development team and should be addressed during forward iteration planning as iteration cycles are completed. Further, this might suggest that the testing/integration team members need to be part of the development team.   
* Government testing personnel need to understand the differences inherent in Agile versus waterfall to adequately adapt staff and time requirements for testing when using Agile. The government testing personnel need to be engaged at the development iteration level; they should not wait until the entire system is completed to initiate their testing work.

## Common Topic for Difficult Conversations: Infrastructure

No matter whether one uses waterfall or Agile, the group undertaking the project needs to have an infrastructure supporting it. This would include the organization of the team and the context within which the team operates. The overall organization of a project using Agile is different from the traditional program structure. The structure for an Agile project reflects Agile precepts and is reliant on the context in which it will be applied. 

**Context:** For large programs there is the need for early decisions about the support structure including shared assets. To help eliminate configuration management issues, the government usually dictates the shared assets of models across contracts and contractors on a large program. Common facilities (or shared assets), such as common logging (for example automated logging of test messages), agreements on units of measure, data models, etc., will be used on all segments and components of large programs. Early decisions on such aspects can appear to be in direct contradiction to the tenets of Agile. However, developers using Agile need to be aware of the larger, system wide constructs during their iteration planning. Developers need to use these as inputs so that they can be accommodated during the Agile implementation. Developers also need to understand that for government programs, the Concept of Operations (CONOPS) developed for the overall system by the government strongly influences and provides the context for the capability stories used in Agile development. Therefore, an up-front operational architecture needs to be defined as part of the CONOPS, and all developers of the overall system need to understand that conventional “use cases” and Agile “stories” are different in construction and application. Agile “stories” are less-formal constructs written as informal English descriptions. “Use cases” are formal constructs including preconditions, post conditions, and detailed interaction diagrams. 

**Observation:** Some potential organizational ideas for executing Agile in the government acquisition environment: 

* Agile can be experimented with early in the acquisition life cycle to try out what works and what doesn’t. Possible places to experiment might be during analysis of alternatives, risk reduction activities, activities leading up to Milestone B, phases in which only coding is being produced, and Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTDs).   
* For programs just getting involved with Agile, one organizational structure that worked well involved customers on-site at the contractor's facilities using a two week rotational schedule. The interviewees indicated that such a short rotational schedule benefits the contractor team because it typically provides much better access to real users, and it benefits the PMO team because they have better insight into what is going on in development.   
* To help get started with Agile, the contractors brought in an Agile expert who would be embedded in the team and then train his/her way out of the job. This way the Agile team learns by doing, not just from classroom training or books.   
* The contractors created something concrete that behaves in a representative manner, such as an early version or prototype.
  
Large programs with multiple Agile teams had several more ideas:   
* To coordinate project dependencies across multiple Agile development teams, the leaders of the development teams, who typically maintain control of the team through a daily “scrum,” can themselves become members of a team of consisting of all the team leaders (a “scrum of scrums”).   
* To maintain subject matter expertise and foster the cross-training of staff, team leads should be permanent, rotating the staff underneath them. This allows the cross-training of staff in all areas and maintains the team lead as subject matter experts—a “best-of-both worlds” approach.   
* Planning for iterations was difficult with multiple Agile teams running in parallel and working on the same source tree. It was difficult to track feature predecessors. For example, if story A is needed before story B can be implemented, and story A was scheduled to be completed during the last iteration by another team, the development team needs to know if story A actually made it into that iteration before scheduling story B. This problem is made more difficult if both A and B are scheduled for the same iteration because each team can decide for itself which stories get bumped from a particular iteration. In order to preclude this type of behavior, one group made this particular topic part of their daily team lead standups.   
* Dependencies across multiple Agile teams working on a common source tree need frequent coordination. The interviewees pointed out that one possible way of doing this would be to have the Agile team leader scrum (the “scrum of scrums”) meet in a daily standup to track the interdependencies.

## Knowledge Check

1\. True or False

**When preparing for a difficult conversation, it is best to clarify the problem in your own mind first and do a little research to understand the opposing mindset.**

- [x] True  
- [ ] False  

> Correct! Clarifying your thinking and considering the other person’s mindset helps you prepare for a more thoughtful, productive conversation.

---

2\. Scenario-Based Multiple Choice

**Scenario:**  
You're working with a team in your agency that is planning for government/end user reviews of a software product. The team has traditionally held 2–3 day sessions after six months of development to collect feedback all at once. You want to explore whether a more iterative approach would be better, given the difficulty of gathering users for long reviews and the benefits of earlier feedback.

You have a good working relationship with the team lead. She responds to your suggestion by saying:

*“I really appreciate all you’re doing to transform how we do business around here, but we don’t have time or money to break up our reviews and hold them more iteratively. We only have a year period of performance, and our budget is tight! I know what the Agile Manifesto says about the importance of customer collaboration—and we’re doing it! But we’re also adapting it to the realities of the government and our agency.”*

**How should you respond?**

- [x] “Can you talk me through your past experiences with the 2-3 day sessions and how they’ve been used to gather customer feedback? What has worked well? What hasn’t?”  
- [ ] “I have a great case study from another agency about how they implemented this approach and mitigated risk. It really can work in government!”  
- [ ] “I understand where you’re coming from. It doesn’t sound like this is the time to try something different, but please keep it in mind for future efforts.”  

> Correct! This response invites collaboration and reflection without being confrontational. It acknowledges the team’s experience and opens a productive dialogue.

## Introduction -  Building Your Resilience

>As an inventor, Edison made 1,000 unsuccessful attempts at inventing the light bulb. When a reporter asked, "How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?" Edison replied, "I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps."

>During the American Revolution, John Adams said that “we were about one-third Tories, and \[one\] third timid, and one-third true blue.” In other words, a minority of the colonists (only one-third) supported independence from Britain. The other two-thirds either supported Britain or were waiting to see which side won.

>As memorialized in the movie “Lincoln” and many books and movies that preceded it, Abraham Lincoln received pushback when attempting to push forward the Emancipation Proclamation. As Adam Grant describes in his book The Originals, Lincoln spent six months agonizing about this decision before he made it. He was told it would lead to chaos and destroy the nation. Luckily, he didn’t listen.

>Carmen Medina, the former CIA analyst, was repeatedly told “no” by her superiors and peers for more than a decade as she attempted to push for real-time information sharing across intelligence agencies. However, she kept trying—for more than a decade. As a result, she helped create the intelligence community’s version of Wikipedia.

As these examples illustrate, innovation by definition requires risk taking and change. Change is not easy, and people will resist it—even when they suffer most from it (see political psychologist John Jost’s [theory of system justification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_justification) for an interesting application of this). As a result, you’re going to be told no—frequently—as you advance change. Most important initiatives will have more people saying no than saying yes—at first. How do you prime yourself—and your team and agency—to respond productively in these situations and build momentum in support of the change?

In addition, technologists and individuals across the private sector and government talk about “failing fast,” and you’ve learned about building/buying small and missing small. Knowing that failure is okay versus *believing* that it’s okay (and getting your leadership to believe it) are two different things. How do you truly accept and cultivate this mindset over time?

In this module, you’ll learn techniques to help you cultivate your mindset around change and thus, respond productively when you encounter setbacks and pushback. Specifically, you’ll learn:

* Characteristics of a “growth mindset”  
* Wellness rituals and techniques that can enhance your performance during transition  
* How resilience and a growth mindset help you take risks and innovate  
* How to positively respond to negative feedback and failure by analyzing the situation and adjusting your approach  
* How to differentiate between situations where it makes sense to continue pushing for change and others where you may need to redirect

## Cultivating Your Growth Mindset

Consider another example: Walt Disney had great success with 1994’s The Lion King. However, the company struggled thereafter, producing a series of movies that lacked the same popularity with audiences. Then, Disney acquired Pixar in 2006\. Ed Catmull, current president of Disney and Animation and Pixar, describes what happened thereafter in this book, *Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration*. As Catmull describes it, “Creativity has to do with problem solving…the issue is that companies and the officer ... put blocks in the way – well-meaning, trying to think they’re being safe or help things along, but in fact they’re throwing blocks up.” By removing those blocks and adopting Pixar’s culture of risk-taking, the Disney Animation team has since created a series of hits like *Tangled* and *Frozen*—their biggest hits since *The Lion King*. And as Catmull says, “Here’s the key takeaway – it’s largely the same people who were there when they were failing. All we were doing was trying to remove the roadblocks.”

What Disney Animation—and many other firms and individuals—sometimes lack is a true belief in risk taking and the importance of embracing failure as part of the learning journey. Psychologist Carol Dweck explores perspectives on risk-taking, among other things, in her study of what she calls the “growth mindset.” As Dweck explains in her [TED talk on the topic](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve), having a growth mindset is the difference between thinking flexibly and having a static mindset. Dweck has explored how this concept applies to K-12 education as well as to adults and organizations. The infographic below describes some of the main characteristics of this mindset.

![Infographic explaining the characteristics of a fixed vs. growth mindset. A fixed mindset avoids challenges, gives up easily, sees effort as fruitless or worse, ignores useful negative feedback and feels threatened by the success of others. A growth mindset embraces challenges, persists in the face of setbacks, sees effort as the path to master, learns from criticism, and finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/a841b35a44e7356b294d3a5632b66ba6dbe6f9ba/Media/Module%205/growth%20mindset.png)

*Farnam Street Media Inc. (2015, March – April). *Carol Dweck: A summary of growth and fixed mindsets* \[Diagram\]. *Farnam Street*. [https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/](https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/)*

For you and your work in digital services acquisition, two characteristics are particularly relevant and important to cultivate:

* **Perspective on risk:** People who embrace a growth mindset are more willing to step outside of their comfort zone and take risks that might result in a short term “failure.” When you’re advocating for the non-traditional approaches you’ve learned about in this program, chances are that these are relatively—or entirely—new for your agency. As you learned in the Leading Change module, leading change from the middle is not easy; however, it is possible. By working to change your perspective on risk and those of your team members (and employing the other strategies discussed in the Leading Change module), you can gradually contribute to the growth mindset of your organization.  
* **Embracing failure as you challenge the status quo:** By undertaking challenges, you open yourself up to learning opportunities. Failure will be part of that learning—that is, if you make a conscious effort to learn from it. Learning from failure means you analyze what happened and explore what you could’ve done differently to create an alternative outcome. Pixar embodies this approach (read more about their approach, introduced above, [here](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/05/02/creativity-inc-ed-catmull-book/)). NASA is another organization that has adopted this mindset over the years. For instance, in the 1960s during the race to the moon, NASA leadership deliberately encouraged engineers to take more risks. When unmanned rockets exploded on takeoff, department heads would applaud; in this way, everyone would know that their division had tried and failed, but at least they had tried.

## Wellness Rituals to Support You in Times of Transition

As our discussion of the growth mindset indicates, failure is going to be part of your journey. It is normal. If you aren’t failing along the way, then you likely aren’t taking enough risks. As you’ve learned, the key is to take calculated, small risks over time (remember the buy small, miss small principle—this applies in all aspects of work), but learning to accept failure may not come naturally for you. Even if it does, there may be times where the stress gets to you. What do you do to support yourself through the change? We've provided some strategies to help you answer that question.

First, interesting research has been done around treating performance in the workplace much like we treat word-class athletes, in that we consider all components of performance. As performance psychologist Jim Loehr and executive vice president of LGE Tony Schwartz explore in their research (explored in the [“The Making of a Corporate Athlete,” Harvard Business Review, 2001](https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete)):

>*“Some executives thrive under pressure. Others wilt. Is the reason all in their heads? Hardly. Sustained high achievement demands physical and emotional strength as well as a sharp intellect. To bring mind, body, and spirit to peak condition, executives need to learn what world-class athletes already know: recovering energy is as important as expending.”*

Loehr and Schwartz’s used two decades of work at LGE with world-class athletes to create what they termed “The High Performance Pyramid.” They translated its techniques with athletes into high performance in the workplace. Achieving the “Ideal Performance State” requires engagement of all four capacities: the body, the emotions, the mind, and the spirit by treating the individual as a whole being. (Note “spirit” refers to the energy unleashed by tapping into one’s deepest values and defining a strong sense of purpose—for some, that’s religion; for others, that may be the outdoors, connections with family, etc.) The High Performance Period is shown below.

Research has shown that small rituals, repeated over time, can be used to enhance performance in these four areas. “Rituals” refer to the small, relatively low-effort activities you can do every day that can have a big difference.

In times of hardship or transition, it can become easy for healthy routines to slip to the back of your mind. However, your **physical capacity** is important for mental and emotional recovery. It’s easy to get stressed out, angry, or resentful when you’re facing rejection. It’s important to think about ways that you can enhance your **emotional capacity** during these times. Additionally, your **mental capacity** can become hindered, and it may be difficult to stay focused. When your **spiritual capacity** is compromised, you may lack motivation, determination, or endurance. If you want to perform at your best—just like a star athlete—you must pay attention to all four performance areas.

All that said, the reality is there’s a difference between *knowing* you should pay attention to these areas—and then actually *doing* it. As explored in *“Why is resilience so hard?” by Steven Snyder in* Harvard Business Review, if you notice that in times of stress you break from routines that are part of a healthy lifestyle, taking the time to get back on track can have positive outcomes. By exercising and stepping back from your work for self-reflection, you can strengthen each of your capacities. Positive effects from these minor changes include increased clarity and inspired creativity.

When dealing with rejection in the workplace, it’s easy to isolate yourself to avoid facing hardships. Instead of allowing yourself to fall into a rut, try falling back on your support system. Those who are close to you can provide you with motivating encouragement, and can serve as a source for new ideas and inspiration.

Start by thinking about small rituals you can incorporate into your everyday now. Try incorporating one ritual each week to tap into each performance area. Over time, those small rituals become [habits](http://www.npr.org/2012/02/27/147296743/how-you-can-harness-the-power-of-habit)—and habits are a powerful thing. When things become hard or you’re faced with rejection, you’ve already built these behaviors into your everyday, which increases your resilience and keeps you at your “Ideal Performance State.”

## Analyze Where the “No” Came From

So, you’ve been told no. You’ve been cultivating your growth mindset and using wellness techniques to keep you in the right frame of mind. Now it’s time to think through why you were told “no” and determine how to move forward from there.

When you are told “no,” it becomes easy to dwell on what went wrong. It’s common for cognitive traps to take over your thinking and cloud your assessment of the situation after the fact. Often, these blunders encourage a fixed/negative mindset over a growth mindset. Some common cognitive traps, as noted by the [Canadian Mental Health Association](http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/wellness-module/wellness-module-8-healthy-thinking), include:

* **Mindreading**, i.e., jumping to conclusions about what other people are thinking without any evidence  
* **Overgeneralizing**, i.e., thinking that a negative situation is a part of a constant cycle of bad things  
* **Confirmation Bias**, i.e., focusing on the negative evidence from a conversation and ignoring other evidence  
* **Emotional Reasoning**, i.e., believing that negative emotions toward you are reflected in the situation

To avoid falling victim to these cognitive traps, take a step back and revisit your preparation for the conversation. Think back to the Ladder of Inference as a tool to help you think about how the other party in a conversation draws his/her conclusions. Try to consider the role that the Ladder of Inference may have had when you were told “no.” Did the other party interpret the information differently than you expected? Are they even looking at the same information as you in their analysis? 

---
## Should I Fight This Battle, or How Might I Adjust My Approach To Make It More “Winnable”?

Once you’ve analyzed the situation, and you understand the origin of the “no,” assess whether this is a challenge that you should pursue. Ask yourself the following questions:

* **Is this a situation that, if left unaddressed, could cause real harm to my agency or the government or threaten our ability to achieve our mission?** The answer to this question is relative, and it’s not black and white. Recall the discussion from the classroom session and the example included at the beginning of this module about Carmen Medina. Ms. Medina felt that the mission of the CIA—and the intelligence community—was at risk by not having a real-time way to share information.  
* **What are my obstacles and opportunities?** Size up the risks associated with continuing to advocate for this change, and determine if it’s a risk worth taking. Ask yourself: could continuing to push for this change *in the same way* threaten my job? How might I adjust my approach or bide my time until conditions are more favorable? Again, think of Carmen Medina and her approach to change. (Beware of using the “bide my time” approach as a cop-out\!)  
* **How do I advance some change—any change—while also maintaining working relationships?** Consider how to meet the person where they are and advance change incrementally, while maintaining relationships and not demoralizing the team. As you learned earlier, this is the essence of being a network leader, and your role in digital services acquisition; you have to collaborate with people in your network to make change happen. Remember the content around influence? Meeting another person where they are shows that you care about them and makes them more willing to work with you over time. 

***What does this look like in action?*** As you’ve learned throughout this program, USDS, others in government, and now you, have a vision for what a true agile solicitation should look like. However, at times, you may be called in to support a team in your agency or another agency that has already spent time developing an RFQ that doesn’t quite align with that vision. This is something Traci and Jonathan, two of the innovative procurement experts and thought leaders mentioned in Module 1, have experience with firsthand. For instance, they have been called in to review an RFQ that an agency team has been working on for three months and that is now 100 pages long. The agency team is energized and excited about it. Even if the solicitation doesn’t align with the vision that you, Traci, or Jonathan would advocate for, the battle isn’t won by throwing out what the team has been working on. Instead, consider how to take what the team has worked on, make tweaks, and include an exit strategy so that the team has a way out if something goes wrong. This allows you to find a middle ground that helps meet the team where they are, advances some change, maintains your working relationship and keeps the team’s energy up, and protects the government from some of the biggest risks.

If you determine that you should revisit the conversation, think about taking a different approach and the trade offs that come with adjusting your approach. Put on your consultant hat and think about how to move the needle incrementally. If you can’t fully implement the change that you were pushing for, can you make a smaller change to later build from? Remember the old mantra, Rome wasn’t built in a day. It may help to ask yourself some of these questions:

* Who is your audience, and what are their needs?  
* What is the primary message of the conversation?  
* How should you open the conversation?  
* Which trade off will you present?

Refer back to your Change and Innovation Readiness Survey from Module 2 to help you assess how you should move forward. Based on your agency’s change and innovation readiness, recognize how drastic a change you should be pushing for, e.g., if your agency hasn’t used true agile methods for digital services development, try testing it out on a small task before trying to implement it more broadly.

## What to Do When You’re Told No \- Framework in Action

Now that you’ve learned about a framework you can use to figure out why you were told “no” and how to respond, try putting it into practice in the scenario that follows.

### Part 0

First, review the scenario below:

You are working with a technical team to draft a solicitation. The technical team has recently experienced challenges that put them in the public spotlight for some IT failures. They need to find a new vendor. They have told you many times that we “can’t mess this one up” and that “we can’t introduce risk.” The previous contract failed, in part, because of a reliance on a waterfall-based method and a contract that had a lengthy list of system requirements but no statement that the software needed to work. The solution to fix this problem seems so obvious to you—they need to write a contract that supports agile software development\! You’re excited coming out of this class, and you tell them what your diagnosis of the problem is and how you have a solution that can really improve results and deliver what their users need. You finish your presentation to them. Silence. Uncomfortable shifting in their seats. Finally, someone speaks up, “That’s great and all that you’re some expert in digital services acquisition, but that’s not how things work in the real world. Swooping in and making large-scale changes like this—that will not work here in this organization right now. Maybe next year when things settle down.” You’re floored. The solution is sitting right in front of them\! How could they be so deluded?\!

Review the following factors were at play in this situation:

* The Availability and Representativeness Biases may have come into play here. The way you presented your solution made it sound like a large divergence from their current practices, making them more likely to resist or want to control it.  
* You used your Expert Power in a way that was threatening to the technical team and that made them less likely to hear and listen to your ideas.  
* If this is a technical team that you don’t frequently work with, then you might have considered enlisting someone whom they trust to help you deliver the message and/or presenting it in a humbler way, asking questions and getting their input along the way.

### Part 1: Analyze the no

Knowledge Check

So what’s next?

Analyze the “no” a bit more. Besides not presenting the change in a way that made it sound less “scary” and using Expert Power inappropriately with a team that you haven’t worked with extensively, what else was driving the “no” response?

**Select 2 responses that apply:**

- [x] The technical team recognizes there is a problem with the status quo, but ironically is resistant to change it—system justification theory at work!  
- [x] The technical team is so afraid of another failure that they’re afraid to do anything that might “rock the boat” (like the Disney Animation studio before they acquired Pixar).  
- [ ] The technical team likely didn’t trust you because they didn’t know your credentials. You should’ve started your presentation by listing your credentials and the successful contracts you’ve administered in the past.  

> Correct! Both resistance due to system justification and fear of failure are common, human responses to change. Credentials alone won’t necessarily build trust or shift deeply rooted team dynamics.


### Part 2: How Might I Adjust My Approach to Make it More Winnable?

Knowledge Check

You’ve determined that this is an important enough topic that you should pursue it, but that you need to change up your approach. So, size up the situation, obstacles, and opportunities. Think of small incremental changes you can make. Given the environment and what has recently happened, what should you do?

**Select the best response:**

- [ ] Send the technical team links and examples that you’ve read, which discuss how to make this approach work in government. Once they see the use cases from other agencies, they’ll be more likely to try it out in your agency.  
- [ ] Let some time pass so that the memory of the recent IT failure starts to fade, then reengage and present your idea again.  
- [x] Brainstorm just one small task or part of the solicitation where you can test this approach. Present the idea as just that—an idea that you want to test. Discuss the benefits that could result. Work with someone the technical team trusts and have them present the idea with you.  

> Correct! Introducing a small, testable change and aligning with trusted voices increases your chance of buy-in and minimizes perceived risk.

## Adjust Approach & Identify Lessons Learned

Now that you’ve assessed the root of the “no,” considered whether or how to advance change, and considered the right-size amount of change, determine how best to approach the situation. Use the Lean “[build-measure-learn](http://theleanstartup.com/principles)” approach here. Decide how to adjust, test it out, and see how it works. Then, learn from the experience by documenting lessons learned and sharing them with others.

Remember our discussion of wellness rituals and performance areas from our earlier discussion? [Well, it just so happens that research shows that capitalizing on your strengths leads you to feel revitalized](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910003946). Another wellness ritual to add to your arsenal\! If you’re dealing with a difficult situation, remind yourself and affirm your strengths. Then, think about how to leverage those strengths along your change and innovation journey.

## Telling Your Procurement Story

### Sharing What You’ve Learned to Help Others Succeed

**Why Your Story Matters**

Digital service procurement is constantly evolving. What worked last year might not work today—and what you figure out today might help someone else tomorrow. That’s why telling the story of your procurement work—what went right, what went sideways, and what you’d do differently—is such a powerful contribution to the community.

You don’t have to be a professional writer. You just have to be willing to reflect, be honest, and share. Storytelling helps you communicate complex decisions, lessons, and context that others might not find in a policy memo or contract clause. By putting your real-world experiences into words, you help others learn faster and navigate similar challenges with more confidence.

As a DITAP graduate, you’ve learned a lot about designing smarter, more flexible procurements. Now, you’re in a great position to pay it forward by documenting what worked (and what didn’t) and sharing your experience with others. Think of it as contributing to the larger body of knowledge—one story at a time.

### Why Sharing Matters in Government Procurement

#### When You Share, Everyone Gets Smarter

We all know procurement can be messy, especially when you’re dealing with new technologies, tight timelines, or unexpected curveballs. But every procurement teaches you something—about collaboration, process, communication, risk, or innovation. When you share those lessons, it helps the whole ecosystem work better.

Knowledge sharing helps:

* Make future procurements stronger by avoiding repeat mistakes

* Build resilience by highlighting how you adapted to challenges

* Spread good ideas across agencies

* Create a record of lessons learned that others can build on

Whether it’s a quick blog post, a deeper case study, or a hallway chat, these conversations add up to a smarter, more connected acquisition workforce.

#### Stories Help Make Sense of the Work

Let’s be real: most acquisition work isn’t linear. You make trade-offs, adapt plans, and build relationships that shape the outcome. A story gives you the space to explain the “why” and “how” behind the decisions—not just the end result. That kind of nuance is hard to capture in checklists or templates, but stories bring it to life.

They also help others *feel* the experience. A good story isn’t just informative—it’s memorable. That emotional connection helps others remember the lesson and apply it later, even in totally different situations.

#### What’s Worth Sharing?

There are two types of knowledge to think about when telling your story:

* Explicit knowledge is easy to document—things like policies, templates, and rules.

* Tacit knowledge is harder to explain—it’s the gut instincts, relationship strategies, and workarounds you develop through experience.

Your procurement story is a great way to turn that tacit knowledge into something useful for others. Talk about the decisions you made, the questions you asked, the conversations that helped move things forward. These details are gold for other acquisition professionals who might face similar situations.

#### Building a Culture of Sharing Starts With Us

For knowledge sharing to really take root, we need to normalize it—and that starts with leadership and culture. That means:

* Creating space for learning from mistakes, not hiding them

* Encouraging open, judgment-free conversations

* Recognizing and rewarding people who take time to reflect and share

Psychological safety plays a big part in this. People need to feel safe being honest, even when things didn’t go perfectly. And while financial rewards aren’t always feasible, small things like public shout-outs, leadership support, or adding knowledge sharing to performance goals can go a long way.

### Blogging Your Procurement Journey

#### Why Blog?

Blogging is one of the easiest ways to start sharing what you know. It doesn’t have to be fancy or long—just honest, helpful, and clear. Think of it as talking to a colleague who wasn’t in the room but wants to understand how you approached something tricky or how a particular strategy played out. Check out [TTS’s Blogging Guide](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/office-of-operations/blogging/) for more guidance and other ways to get started.

Sharing your experiences helps others feel less alone, speeds up learning across teams, and builds a sense of community. Plus, it reinforces your own thinking and makes your work visible—both inside and outside your agency.

Blogs can:

* Break down what worked and why  
* Highlight tools, templates, or techniques others can borrow  
* Help you process challenges and share lessons learned  
* Serve as starting points for bigger case studies

The act of blogging is also a form of "working in the open." It models the user-centered, iterative approach we push for in digital services.

#### Good Blogging is User-Centered Too

Sound familiar? Just like our digital service work, good blogging puts the user (in this case, the reader) first.

Ask yourself:

* Who am I writing for?  
* What do I want them to learn?  
* What will help them do their work better?

A blog post doesn’t have to be long—500 to 800 words is often enough. Use plain language. Break things into sections with clear headers. Add links or visuals if it helps. Be specific. Be real. And make sure it’s accessible (use good contrast, alt text, and readable fonts).

#### Blog Structure: Keep it Simple

Use a basic "problem-solution-impact" structure:

* Problem: What were you trying to solve?  
* Solution: What did you try? How did you approach it?  
* Impact: What happened? What changed? What would you do differently?

End with a small call to action, like inviting others to try the approach, share feedback, or connect for more info.

### Writing a Procurement Case Study

#### What Makes a Good Case Study?

Case studies have been a core part of this course—used to evaluate vendor approaches, support your in-class activities, and serve as key reference material drawn from the Periodic Table of Acquisition Innovations. They help us learn not just by doing, but by seeing how others have approached similar challenges. In fact, creating your own case study is an outstanding way to reflect and capture the insights you’ve gained from a particular strategy, approach, or procurement process. It helps solidify your learning and contributes to the broader community of practice. Case studies give you the chance to go deep—to show not just what happened, but how and why. They offer a fuller picture of your procurement approach, including the real-world conditions that shaped your decisions and the results that followed.

They're not just stories to read; they're tools for learning. Whether someone is looking for examples to follow or pitfalls to avoid, a well-written case study becomes a how-to guide grounded in lived experience.

#### Key Elements of a Great Case Study

A good case study balances narrative and analysis. It provides the big picture and zooms in on key moments that changed the direction or tone of the work. Here's how you might break it down:

* **Title:** Choose something short but specific that gives a sense of the outcome or topic (e.g., "Improving Vendor Feedback with a Two-Week Sprint Review").  
* **Summary:** Write a short paragraph at the top that covers the key points: what the problem was, how you approached it, and what changed as a result.  
* **Context:** Set the stage. What agency or program is this? What was the mission or objective of the project? Include timelines, user populations, or anything that helps ground the reader.  
* **Problem:** Be honest and clear about the challenge. Was it a tight timeline? A policy hurdle? A team that had never done agile before? The more specific you are, the easier it is for others to relate and learn.  
* **Solution:** What did you actually do? Talk about the procurement method you chose, the design of the solicitation, how you built the team, or any new processes you tested. Include rationale: why did you take that approach?  
* **Journey:** This is the meat of the story. What surprises came up? What needed to shift along the way? Share both the high points and the friction—team dynamics, evaluation challenges, collaboration with vendors. Show your work and describe how you responded.  
* **Results:** What was the outcome? Use data when you can (number of vendors, user satisfaction scores, cost savings, etc.), but also describe qualitative impact. What changed for the team, the agency, or the end users?  
* **Takeaways:** Reflect on what you learned. What would you do again? What would you change? These are the parts that help others skip the guesswork.  
* **Call to Action:** Invite others to try the method, borrow a tool you used, or reach out for more context. This turns your story into an ongoing conversation.

#### Tips for Writing a Strong Case Study

* **Use plain language.** Don’t assume readers know your agency’s acronyms or internal jargon.  
* **Make it skimmable.** Use bullet points, headers, and pull quotes so readers can scan and dig in where needed.  
* **Be real.** It's okay to admit where things got hard or didn't go as planned. Those are often the most helpful parts of the story.  
* **Include supporting materials.** Add links to relevant RFQs, templates, evaluation criteria, or performance dashboards if you can. These make it easier for others to reuse what worked.  
* **Tell a story.** Use a narrative arc. Think beginning (the challenge), middle (what you tried), and end (what happened). It helps readers stay engaged.

By documenting your process in this way, you help others avoid having to reinvent the wheel. You show that good procurement work isn't always linear or perfect—and that shared learning makes us all better.

We have included a sample case study template for Procurements of AI Tools, which is a relevant and immediate topic. The more agencies can share what and how they are procuring AI solutions, the better everyone will get. 

### Navigating Disclosure: What and How to Share

While transparency is a core principle, acquisition professionals must understand the boundaries of what information can be shared. This involves careful consideration of sensitive information, proprietary data, and ongoing legal or contractual obligations. The focus should remain on sharing lessons learned, process improvements, and measurable public benefits. Government guidelines on transparency, even in areas like supply chains, often detail requirements for disclosing organizational structure, supply chain overview, long-term partnerships, and how information was gathered. 

Emphasis is placed on detailed disclosure requirements and data accuracy and verification in procurement documents. For audit purposes, it is often advised to "over-document everything" and to "Trust, but verify" vendor data.  

Navigating disclosure requires a balance between openness and strategic protection. While extensive disclosure requirements exist in government and procurement, there is an inherent tension between complete transparency and safeguarding sensitive commercial or national security information. Acquisition professionals need to understand that sharing "what worked well" should be done in a manner that provides actionable insights without compromising competitive advantage for vendors or sensitive government operations. This often necessitates careful judgment and potentially redacting specific figures or proprietary details while still conveying the core lessons and benefits. It is about *strategic* transparency that maximizes public benefit without undue risk. The ability to share transparent stories about procurement success is directly tied to the quality and completeness of internal documentation. The advice to "Over-document everything" for audit trails and the observation that "Better Record Management" is a benefit of transparency underscore this connection. Acquisition professionals should be encouraged to maintain meticulous records throughout the acquisition process, not solely for compliance, but as a foundational element for future storytelling. Robust documentation makes it easier to verify claims, provide evidence, and ensure the accuracy required for public sharing.

### Getting Internal Approval to Publish

Publishing your procurement story often means getting approval from your agency’s communications office, Office of General Counsel (OGC), and sometimes public affairs or external media teams. Don’t let that slow you down—there are steps you can take to make the process smoother and increase your chances of a green light.

Tips to navigate approvals:

* Start early: Mention your intention to publish while the project is still active. This helps stakeholders feel looped in from the beginning.  
* Use plain language: Draft your blog or case study using non-technical, non-promotional language. This helps reviewers see the value in knowledge sharing, not PR.  
* Focus on the facts: Stick to lessons learned, tools used, approaches tested, and measurable impact. Avoid vendor endorsements or sensitive details.  
* Frame it as value to the public: Emphasize how this story contributes to government transparency, shared learning, and better service delivery.  
* Ask about templates or prior examples: Your agency may have a preferred format or clearance checklist. Starting from one makes things easier.  
* Engage OGC early: Legal reviews can take time. Share your intent with them, highlight any sensitive areas, and be open to redactions if needed.  
* Offer informal briefings: Sometimes, a quick conversation with comms or legal teams can speed up understanding and buy-in.

Framing your story as a contribution to professional development and government-wide learning often shifts the tone from "risk" to "value." The more you position yourself as a thoughtful steward of your agency’s mission, the more likely you are to get support.
