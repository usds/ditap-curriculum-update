## DITAP Course: What to Expect, How to Navigate

### Introduction to DITAP

* Program overview  
  * Certification  
    * The Digital Services Credential (DITAP), formerly FAC-C-DS, program aims to train and develop professionals for this certification, focusing on digital service acquisition. It requires a comprehensive approach that includes pre and post-course assessments, multi-modal training delivery utilizing a learning management system, and evaluation based on participation, mastery of content, and a live digital assignment. The program emphasizes a cohort-based learning approach which can be both in-person or fully remote for the majority of facilitation or the majority of content. The curriculum, structured in modules and sprints, covers competencies such as understanding digital services, effective buying techniques, contract administration, and leading change in digital IT acquisition, with the goal of providing participants with practical skill development through real-world application and problem-solving. FAC-C (Professional) holders with at least two years of experience and assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services over FAR 13.500(c) thresholds are required to attend the DITAP training program. FAC-COR Level II/III and FAC-P/PM Level II/III holders with at least two years of experience and assigned to acquisitions consisting primarily of digital services over FAR 13.500(c) thresholds are encouraged to attend DITAP training to create a cohesive team that fully understands how to buy digital services.

    * Course Structure  
      * **Course Modules:** The program is divided into five modules, each with multiple sprints:  
        * **Module 1: Describe:** Focuses on understanding what digital services are, who provides them, how they are delivered, and why they are important. This includes topics like the digital services landscape, delivery methods (Agile, Design/User Centered Design/DevSecOps), and a "Tech Bootcamp" covering data, software, cloud, AI, security, accessibility, and open source.  
        * **Module 2: Discover:** Emphasizes engaging in a discovery process to inform acquisition strategy decisions. This involves assessing agency readiness, stakeholder and customer mapping, defining success for digital service acquisitions, and conducting effective market research.  
        * **Module 3: Design:** Concentrates on translating discovery findings into a structured solicitation. It covers developing acquisition strategies, creating solicitations, and running successful evaluations.  
        * **Module 4: Build:** Focuses on managing vendor partnerships and supporting delivery through contract administration practices, grounded in agile and lean methodologies. Topics include management of digital service delivery, performance measurement, contract kickoff, and contract management/problem resolution.  
        * **Module 5: Grow:** Aims to apply techniques to create a culture of innovation, enabling participants to lead and influence customers towards optimal solutions. This includes leading change as an individual and leading organizational change through continuous improvement and scalable practices.  
      * **Case Study Integration:** The program utilizes a threaded case study, "Cynuria: Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges," to provide a realistic, evolving scenario for applied learning across the modules. Vendors are responsible for ensuring the case study is integrated to align with learning objectives and reinforce key principles.  
      * **Live Digital Assignment (LDA):** This capstone project simulates the end-to-end lifecycle of a modern digital service acquisition, reinforcing core DITAP objectives. It involves four phases: Discovery Sprint, Case Study Development, Evaluation & Feedback, and Final Presentations. Participants identify their own real-world digital service procurement challenge and apply Agile and Human-Centered Design principles.

### Orientation to LMS

**Orientation to the LMS (for Course Providers)**

Please include a brief orientation to your LMS as part of the course introduction. This section should be tailored to your specific Learning Management System (LMS) and help learners feel comfortable navigating the system.

At a minimum, please cover:

* **How to access the LMS** (e.g., login instructions, account setup, links)

* **Overview of the course layout and structure** — How the course is organized, what modules are included, and where to start

* **How to find key elements** — Where to locate modules, assignments, assessments, and any required readings or resources

* **How learners can track their progress** — What progress indicators are available and how they work (if applicable)

* **Communication tools** — How learners will interact with instructors, support staff, and other learners (e.g., discussion boards, messaging features, announcements)

* **Where to go for technical support or help** — Who to contact and how if they encounter technical issues

The goal is to make sure learners can confidently access and navigate your course from the very beginning. This helps set them up for success and reduces frustration.
