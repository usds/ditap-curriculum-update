## DITAP SEL Adaptation Purpose 
A strategic leadership course that complements the core DITAP program but adopts a distinct approach; instead of focusing on tactical execution and hands-on skills, it emphasizes strategic oversight and decision-making. The course revolves around key learning areas, starting with strategic vision development that helps leaders see how digital acquisition fits into their agency's bigger modernization picture and mission. We develop organizational change leadership skills to enable leaders to guide cultural transformation within their acquisition teams effectively. The course emphasizes portfolio management for overseeing multiple digital acquisitions across the enterprise, while stakeholder engagement modules focus on managing relationships with chief information officers, program executives, and external partners. Risk management components address strategic risk assessment and mitigation in digital acquisitions, while innovation governance modules educate leaders on how to create environments that foster innovation in acquisitions.

## Target Audience
Cross-functional federal staff involved in shaping, managing, or influencing digital service delivery and acquisition. Ideal for federal acquisition leaders or professionals across acquisition leadership roles, such as:
- Political appointees
- Senior executives
- Stakeholders who play a role in the strategy of digital services and IT procurement for an agency
- DITAP alumni looking to refresh their skills and advance their careers
