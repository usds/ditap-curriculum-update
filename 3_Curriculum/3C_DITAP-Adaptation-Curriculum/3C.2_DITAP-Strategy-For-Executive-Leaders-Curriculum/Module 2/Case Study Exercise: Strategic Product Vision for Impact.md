- How easily can this be adapted to other contexts?
- What training or support is needed for widespread adoption?
- How will this solution evolve?

### HCD exercise debrief - Answer key

**1. Question: How did the HCD approach change your understanding of the problem?**__
- Expected answer: The HCD approach typically reveals that procurement challenges are often user experience problems rather than purely technical or policy issues. Participants usually find that focusing on user needs reveals solutions that wouldn't emerge from process-focused analysis.

**Key learning points**:
- User perspective shift: Moving from "how do we fix our process?" to "how do we help users succeed?" often reveals different problems entirely
- Root cause discovery: User research uncovers underlying issues that aren't apparent from process analysis alone
- Solution reframing: Solutions that serve user needs often improve process efficiency as a side benefit
- Complexity reduction: User-focused solutions often eliminate unnecessary complexity that exists only for internal reasons

**2. Question: What surprised you about focusing on users rather than processes?**__
- Expected answer: Most participants are surprised by how much complexity they can eliminate by prioritizing user outcomes over process compliance. They often discover that many procedural requirements don't actually serve user needs and may actively impede mission success.

**Key learning points**:
- Unnecessary complexity: Many process steps exist for historical reasons rather than current needs
- User workarounds: Users often create informal solutions that work better than official processes
- Outcome focus: Users care about results, not the specific steps to achieve them
- Efficiency opportunities: User-centered approaches often improve both experience and efficiency

**3. Question: How can executives create space for this type of discovery?**__
- Expected answer: Executives can create space by protecting time for user research, encouraging teams to question existing processes, and demonstrating that user outcomes are valued over process perfection. This approach requires cultural change and explicit permission to challenge the status quo.

**Key learning points**:
- Time protection: User research requires dedicated time that must be protected from other priorities
- Cultural permission: Teams need explicit permission to question existing processes and propose changes
- Outcome prioritization: Executive messaging must emphasize user success over process compliance
- Change support: Leaders must support teams who propose modifications based on user research
