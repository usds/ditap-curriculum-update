# Calculating Delayed Decision Costs

Every day you delay a procurement decision costs your agency money, reduces mission effectiveness, and frustrates the people you serve. Most leaders underestimate these costs because they focus on obvious expenses while missing the hidden impacts of waiting.

## The Hidden Economics of "Let's Wait and See"

When you delay a procurement decision, you're not just postponing costs—you're compounding them. 

**Here's what's happening:**

Your people are burning time: If six people are waiting for a procurement decision, and their annual loaded labor rate averages $150,000, each month of delay costs $75,000 in lost productivity due to idle time. But that's just the apparent cost. What else could these people accomplish if they weren't stuck in procurement limbo?

You're paying for systems you're not using: Your agency is paying for licenses, cloud infrastructure, and support contracts, whether you're using them effectively or not. Delaying a decision about a new customer relationship management system might mean you're paying for both the old system and the new one while getting value from neither.

Vendors are charging you a "delay premium."Vendors build uncertainty into their pricing. If your agency has a reputation for slow decisions, vendors charge more to compensate for the risk. They also reserve their best talent for clients who can move quickly, leaving you with less experienced teams.

Your users are paying the price: Every month you delay improving a citizen-facing system, you're imposing costs on the people you serve. If veterans spend an extra hour per month navigating a poorly designed benefits portal, and 100,000 veterans use the system, that's 100,000 hours of wasted time monthly, equivalent to 48 full-time employees.

Your technical debt is growing: Delaying technology decisions doesn't freeze the status quo—it makes things worse. Legacy systems become increasingly difficult to maintain, security vulnerabilities proliferate, and integration challenges become more complex.

## Calculate Delays 

* Define the delay period.  
  * Calculate the number of weeks or months the decision was delayed.  
* Estimate the cost of inaction or idle time.  
  * **Team & labor cost**: Multiply the number of people waiting (project team, contractors, etc.) by their loaded labor rate and the time delay.  
  * **Tooling or platform waste**: Subscription or license costs incurred during the inactivity (AWS, software tools, etc.).  
  * **Other ancillary costs**: Some vendors charge for standby time, user research may become obsolete, or delays may result in outdated tools or software versions.   
* Quantify opportunity cost.  
  * Estimate the value of foregone benefits that would have been delivered without delay, like reduced user friction, increased efficiency, or avoided rework and technical debt.  
* Calculate potential escalating vendor costs.  
  * Vendors may increase costs due to delays resulting from change orders, scope creep, or the expiration of pricing terms.

## Strategies to Avoid Cost Delays

* Utilize delay cost data to advocate for more adaptive governance models, such as modular contracting and decentralized technical authorities.  
* Champion early approvals of MVPs to mitigate risk while unlocking progress  
* Translate the cost of indecision and delays into impact metrics.  
* Align procurement timelines with priorities and policy goals.  
* Reduce bottlenecks by delegating tactical approvals to empowered product or program owners.  
* Support leadership at the right level.  
* Codify escalation paths for strategic pivots.  
* Create a reputation for predictability and timely decisions.  
* Encourage vendors to offer more innovative, competitive, and mission-aligned solutions.  
* Avoid inflated pricing, expired proposals, or disinterest from top-performing vendors due to perceived friction or indecision.  
* Include delay costs in program retros, dashboards, and acquisition reviews.  
* Lead data-informed discussions on where to accelerate, delegate, or transform decision-making. 

## Strategic Transition from Monolithic to Modular Contracting

Transitioning from traditional large-scale contracts to modular approaches necessitates a systematic change management approach that addresses technical, organizational, and cultural barriers. This isn't just a procurement change—it's an organizational transformation.

## Understanding the Transition Challenge

**Why monolithic contracting persists**:

* Familiarity and comfort with traditional approaches  
* Risk perception that larger contracts are "safer"  
* Organizational structures designed for single-vendor oversight  
* Budget processes that favor large, predictable expenditures  
* Legal and compliance comfort with established precedents

**The modular advantage**:

* Reduced vendor lock-in and increased competition  
* Faster delivery through parallel development  
* Lower risk through smaller, manageable components  
* Greater flexibility to adapt to changing requirements  
* Innovation opportunities through competitive pressure

## The Five-Phase Transition Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-6)**

**Capability development**:

* Train product managers in modular oversight and integration management  
* Develop internal technical architecture and integration expertise  
* Build vendor relationship management capabilities for multiple partnerships  
* Create legal and contracting expertise in modular approaches

**Organizational preparation**:

* Modify budget processes to support modular funding approaches  
* Adapt governance structures for multiple-vendor oversight  
* Create integration and coordination capabilities  
* Establish success metrics focused on user outcomes rather than vendor compliance

**Stakeholder alignment**:

* Build coalition support among key decision-makers and influencers  
* Address resistance through education and successful examples  
* Secure executive commitment to a sustained change effort

**Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Months 7-12)**

**Pilot project selection**:

* Choose projects with manageable scope and complexity  
* Select initiatives with supportive stakeholders and clear user needs

* Plan for extensive learning capture and documentation

**Modular design**:

* Break selected projects into independent, deliverable components  
* Design clear interfaces and integration requirements  
* Establish component-level success criteria and acceptance standards  
* Create vendor competition opportunities within the modular structure

**Process development**:

* Implement product management oversight for modular components  
* Establish vendor coordination and communication protocols  
* Create integration testing and quality assurance processes  
* Develop performance measurement and feedback systems

**Phase 3: Capability Scaling (Months 13-18)**
