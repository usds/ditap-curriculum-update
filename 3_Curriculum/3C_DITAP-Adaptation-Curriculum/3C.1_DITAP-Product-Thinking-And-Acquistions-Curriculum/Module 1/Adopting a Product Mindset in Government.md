# Adopting a Product Mindset in Government
Delivering effective digital services requires a shift in how government teams think about technology. That’s where the product mindset comes in.

Adopting a product mindset means moving away from delivering one-time, fixed-scope projects and instead focusing on continuously improving services based on real user needs. It emphasizes adaptability, long-term value, and user outcomes over rigid timelines and checklists.

Digital service teams embrace a **product mindset** because it supports iterative delivery, user-centered design, and long-term sustainability. It enables teams to learn from real users, adapt as needed, and deliver value continuously—not just at the moment of launch.
