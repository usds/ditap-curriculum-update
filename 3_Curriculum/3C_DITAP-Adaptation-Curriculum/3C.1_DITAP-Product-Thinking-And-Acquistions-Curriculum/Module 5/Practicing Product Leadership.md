# Practicing Product Leadership 

Product leadership is not just about making big decisions—it’s about the daily behaviors, questions, and expectations that shape how teams think and work. This section invites you to reflect on how your actions, language, and mindset influence the culture around you. In agile environments, leadership shows up in the way you model curiosity, support learning, and help others stay focused on outcomes over outputs.

## Self-Awareness and Culture Shaping

**What do you reward or praise?**

Your praise teaches the team (and vendors) what “good” looks like. Celebrating on-time delivery regardless of impact reinforces speed over value. Praising insight, collaboration, or bold pivots shows that learning and user outcomes matter.

*Reflect on:*

* Are you recognizing just the “what,” or also the “why” and “how”?  
* Do you spotlight curiosity, progress, and user-centered behavior?

**How do you respond when things don’t go as planned?**

This is where leadership becomes visible. Blame shuts teams down. Curiosity keeps them learning. When you ask, “What did we learn?” instead of “Who messed up?” you foster resilience and trust.

*Reflect on:*

* Do your reactions encourage transparency or fear?  
* Are you modeling psychological safety and adaptability?

**What expectations do you set for vendors and teams?**  

People rise to meet the expectations you make visible. If you emphasize compliance and documentation, you’ll get compliance and documentation. If you emphasize iteration and outcomes, teams will focus on delivering value.

*Reflect on:*

* Have you clearly communicated what “good” looks like?  
* Are your expectations grounded in values like agility, user focus, and transparency?

**What questions do you ask during demos or retros?**

The questions you ask signal what matters. When you ask about learning, user impact, or next steps, you reinforce a growth mindset. When you only ask about bugs or deliverables, the team may miss the bigger picture.

*Reflect on:*

* Are your questions focused on outcomes, not just outputs?  
* Do you prompt learning, alignment, and product thinking?

**What language do you use to describe progress?**  

Language shapes culture. Saying “we’re behind” implies failure. Saying “we’ve learned and adjusted” highlights agility. The way you describe work influences how teams perceive success.

*Reflect on:*

* Are you talking about timelines and features—or about goals, users, and impact?  
* Are you reinforcing momentum and adaptability, or fear of falling short?

## Practice Area: Learning and Adaptation

These prompts form the foundation of a product-centered culture. Leaders who are willing to reflect, adjust, and share their thinking foster teams that do the same. This is how we move from managing work to enabling meaningful, mission-driven outcomes.

**Do you share what you learn?**  

Leaders who talk about what they’re learning—about users, constraints, delivery challenges—build trust and signal that discovery is part of the process.

*Reflect on:*

* Do you regularly share insights and lessons learned?  
* Are you helping others connect the dots between what you learn and what you do next?

**Do you normalize change and iteration?**  

Change is a healthy part of agile delivery. Teams that feel punished for pivoting will cling to outdated plans. Product leaders create space for thoughtful adjustment.

*Reflect on:*

* Do you treat change as progress or as a disruption?  
* Are feedback loops and course corrections part of your team’s rhythm?

**Do you invite your team to challenge assumptions?**  

Strong teams ask why, offer alternatives, and push for clarity. Leaders set the tone for whether that’s welcomed or avoided.

*Reflect on:*

* When was the last time someone challenged a decision—and you welcomed it?  
* Do your actions create space for thoughtful disagreement and shared problem solving?

## Optional Reflection Activity: [Product Leader Journal](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3C_DITAP-Adaptation-Curriculum/3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquistions-Curriculum/Module%205/Class%20Activity%3A%20Product%20Leader%20Journal.md) 

One of the most effective ways to strengthen your product mindset is to reflect regularly on how you’re showing up as a leader. This journal is a simple tool to help you track your growth. Each day or week, take a few minutes to capture what you’ve learned, what assumptions you’ve challenged, and where you modeled (or could have modeled) product thinking. Over time, these small reflections build powerful self-awareness and intentional habits.

## Closing Commitment Reflection

To wrap up this module, take a moment to reflect on your personal leadership practice.

**Prompt:** *What is one behavior you will commit to modeling this month that reflects a product mindset?*

After reflecting individually, be prepared to share your commitment aloud. We’ll invite a few volunteers to close us out.

## Module 5 Summary: Why Leading with a Product Mindset Matters

In this module, we explored how product leaders play a crucial role in shaping the success of digital services \- not just through formal authority, but by how they lead, speak, and behave.

### What we learned

* **Product mindset is more than a concept—it’s a practice.**  
  It means focusing on outcomes, learning from users, and iterating based on evidence—not just delivering what was scoped.  
* **Leadership happens in everyday moments.**  
  Program leaders influence culture in how they give feedback, ask questions, escalate risks, or talk about progress.  
* **Modeling matters.**  
  The way you show up tells others what’s valued. Modeling curiosity, adaptability, and user focus can shift entire teams.  
* **Influence doesn’t require authority.**  
  You can drive change by asking different questions, framing problems around user needs, and telling stories that highlight impact.  
* **Continuous learning is part of leadership.**  
  Great product leaders stay curious, reflect often, and make time to share what they learn with others.

### Why it matters

Federal teams face complex challenges, evolving technologies, and increasing expectations from the public. Delivering better services requires more than better tools—it requires **better leadership at every level**.

When PMs lead with a product mindset, they:

* Accelerate innovation by focusing on outcomes.  
* Build trust across procurement, technical, and mission teams.  
* Create cultures where iteration, learning, and user needs come first.  
* Become multipliers—helping others grow, shift, and deliver smarter.

**You don’t need to change the whole system overnight. You just need to model what good looks like—and others will follow**.
