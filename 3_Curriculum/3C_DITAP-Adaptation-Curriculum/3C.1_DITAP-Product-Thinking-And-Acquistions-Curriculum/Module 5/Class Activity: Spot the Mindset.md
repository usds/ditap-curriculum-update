# Class Activity: Spot the Mindset 

**Activity Setup:** This activity helps you practice recognizing the difference between a **project mindset** and a **product mindset** in day-to-day language. These subtle shifts in how we talk can shape team behavior, influence decisions, and signal what we value.

## Activity Instructions: 

In pairs, small groups, or as a full group:

1. Read each quote in the table below.  
2. Decide whether the quote reflects a **project mindset** or a **product mindset**.  
3. If it reflects a **project mindset**, rewrite it to better reflect **product thinking**—focusing on users, outcomes, and continuous learning.  
4. Be ready to share and discuss your reasoning.

| Quote | Mindset (Project/Product) | Rewrite with Product Thinking |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "We’ve delivered all milestones on time, so we’re good." |  |  |
| "We included this feature because leadership asked for it." |  |  |
| "We talked to 5 users, and the feedback is shaping our next iteration." |  |  |
| "We need to get this over the finish line, regardless of feedback." |  |  |
| "Let’s review what outcomes this sprint delivered for users." |  |  |

🔍 **Tip:** As you work through the examples, pay attention to what’s being emphasized. Are the quotes focused on deadlines, outputs, or user outcomes? Thinking like a product leader means looking beyond whether work is “done” and asking whether it’s delivering value.
