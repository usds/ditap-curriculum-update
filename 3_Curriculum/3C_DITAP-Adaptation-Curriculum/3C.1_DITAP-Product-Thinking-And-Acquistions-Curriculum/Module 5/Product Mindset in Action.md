# Product Mindset in Action 

Product leadership is less about titles and more about how you show up. Whether you're a Product Manager, Contracting Officer’s Representative, or a program leader, the way you think, speak, and act sends powerful signals to your team. In this section, you’ll explore what it looks like to model a product mindset in your day-to-day work—not through formal authority, but through the influence you build, the questions you ask, and the practices you normalize.

True product thinking is an ongoing practice. It means staying curious, grounded in user needs, open to change, and committed to outcomes rather than just outputs. You’ll examine how everyday interactions—from sprint demos to hallway conversations—can reinforce a culture of learning, iteration, and user focus. Because culture is not taught in a classroom. It is modeled, repeated, and reinforced by the people others look to for direction.

In the pages ahead, you’ll reflect on your own behaviors, learn from real-world scenarios, and identify intentional ways to lead with a product mindset. Your actions can help your team move toward better, more adaptive government services.

## What a Product Mindset Looks Like: 

* **Asking “How do we know this meets user needs?”**

  This emphasizes the importance of evidence-based design. Instead of assuming a solution is good, teams should validate it through user research, feedback, testing, and data. It's a challenge to build the right thing, not just build things right.

* **Challenging scope when there’s no evidence.**

  If a feature or requirement is being proposed, but there’s no clear data or user need to support it, it should be questioned. This is about resisting scope creep and avoiding building unnecessary features that add cost or complexity without value.

* **Prioritizing outcome-based milestones over fixed deliverables.**

  Rather than measuring success by whether a deliverable (like a document or software feature) was completed on time, this approach focuses on whether the work achieved the intended result for users or the mission (e.g., did users successfully submit their application?).

* **Celebrating learning, not just delivery.**

  In modern, agile ways of working, learning quickly and adjusting course is more valuable than blindly sticking to a plan. For example, discovering that a feature idea doesn’t work (and adjusting accordingly) is a success, not a failure.

* **Insisting on cross-functional collaboration.**

  Good digital service work requires diverse expertise — product, design, engineering, legal, acquisition, and user research — all working together, not in silos. Collaboration ensures that solutions are practical, user-centered, and feasible.

Together, these points describe a culture that **challenges traditional, waterfall-style project management** in favor of **flexible, iterative, and user-driven approaches**. It aligns closely with agile, lean, and digital service best practices.

## Behavioral Examples:

| Scenario | Project-aligned behavior | Product-aligned behavior |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A sprint demo reveals usability issues** | "Log it and move on." | "Let’s talk about how users experienced this. What can we do differently next sprint?" |
| **Procurement asks for a performance metric** | "On-time delivery of X widgets" | "Progress on helping users complete task Y with fewer errors" |
| **A new scope item is requested** | "Sure, we’ll add it" | "What problem are we trying to solve? What would success look like?" |

Before we dive deeper into strategies for modeling a product mindset, let’s sharpen your ability to recognize it in action. One of the fastest ways to shift culture is by noticing the language we use every day. In this next activity, you’ll practice distinguishing between project-focused and product-focused thinking—and explore how even small changes in language can influence team behavior, decision-making, and delivery outcomes.
