# Conducting User Research
Once you have defined the problem and identified the people involved, the next step is to understand what those people experience when they interact with a government service. This section introduces the core discovery tools that help federal teams uncover those experiences: user research, personas, and journey mapping.

For Contracting Officer Representatives and program staff, these tools are critical. They help you move beyond assumptions and internal preferences, and instead ground acquisition planning in direct evidence from the people your service is meant to support. Understanding user needs, behaviors, and pain points gives you the insight necessary to develop clearer scopes of work, identify practical success criteria, and oversee contracts that deliver real value—not just compliance.

By collecting and synthesizing user insights early, you strengthen your ability to guide vendors, make informed decisions, and ensure that the services you acquire are usable, accessible, and mission-aligned from day one.

## Conduct User Research 
User research is the foundation of a meaningful Discovery Sprint. It helps uncover what real people both inside and outside of government need, struggle with, and expect when interacting with a service. Rather than relying on assumptions, outdated documentation, or internal opinions, user research allows teams to gather direct evidence that informs design, scope, and acquisition decisions.

Good user research shifts the focus from “What do we want to build?” to “What do people need?” It ensures that the government's work is more human-centered, accessible, and practical from the outset.

## Primary Goals of User Research
- Understand who the users are
- What various users are trying to accomplish
- What are the roadblocks that get in the way
- What matters most to them
- What behaviors, frustrations, and workarounds currently exist

### What to ask
In interviews or shadowing, focus on open-ended questions like:
- “Tell me about the last time you used this system.”
- “What were you trying to do?”
- “What worked? What did not work?”
- “What did you expect to happen?”
- “What do you do when you get stuck?”

### Common pitfalls to avoid
- Avoid yes/no questions. Listen for emotion, not just facts.
- Only interviewing internal staff and assuming that reflects the public’s experience.
- Asking leading questions like “Did you find the site helpful?”
- Relying only on survey data without talking to actual users.
- Skipping research entirely because “we already know the problem.” (You probably don’t.)

### Why it matters
User research is where hidden problems, unmet needs, and critical design insights surface. It can:
- Debunk assumptions
- Reveal accessibility issues or digital barriers
- Show the impact of policy and tech decisions on real people
- Help define a clear, actionable scope in a PWS or SOO

## Create or Update User Personas
The purpose of creating user personas is to ensure that services, products, or policies are designed with the real needs, behaviors, and goals of users in mind. 

The personal preferences and assumptions of internal staff often influence agency decisions. However, the most effective choices prioritize the needs of the people we serve. Personas can help teams move beyond assumptions by representing key segments of actual users in a relatable, human-centered way. Personas allow cross-functional teams to better understand and advocate for the diverse individuals who will interact with or be impacted by the solution, for the public, program managers, and internal staff. By grounding decisions in user reality, personas support more effective, inclusive, and widely adopted outcomes.

To ensure broad adoption and meaningful impact, it's essential to involve representatives of all potential users when developing personas. When done thoughtfully, personas help the team stay focused on these key stakeholders and design solutions that are more likely to succeed.

**Benefits**: 
- Focuses on people above other factors
- Deepens your empathy for others
- Summarizes your research findings
- Challenges your preconceptions

### Steps for creating user personas
1. Define the Purpose
    - Identify the rationale for creating personas (example: to guide a discovery sprint, inform product design, improve service delivery).
    - Clarify which decisions the personas will help support.
2. Find Patterns in the Data
Use data collected during user research to:
    - Group users by common traits (example: tasks, goals, frustrations).
    - Look for behavioral or attitudinal patterns, not just demographics.
3. Create Persona Profiles to represent groups of users
Include:
    - Name (fictional but realistic)
    - Role or Situation (example: "Frustrated First-Time Applicant")
    - Goals
    - Pain Points
    - Behavior and Technology Habits
    - Quotes (from actual users if available)
    - Needs and Opportunities
4. Validate with Stakeholders
    - Share draft personas with internal stakeholders and actual users (if possible) to check for realism and relevance.
    - Revise based on feedback.
5. Make Them Actionable
    - Link each persona to user stories, requirements, or decision points.
    - Use them to test assumptions during design, procurement, and implementation.
6. Keep Them Alive
    - Update personas regularly as you gather more data.
    - Use them in sprint planning, roadmap discussions, and stakeholder briefings to keep the user perspective front and center.

## Class Activity: Analyzing Users and Their Pain Points
Now that you’ve learned how to define a clear problem statement and identify key stakeholders and user groups, it’s time to put those skills into practice.

In this activity, you’ll step into a fictional discovery sprint scenario and work with your team to identify user personas and uncover real challenges those users might face. Your goal is to build a shared understanding of the problem space—before jumping to solutions.

This exercise will help you start thinking like a product team by focusing on the people behind the problem and understanding their needs, pain points, and lived experiences. What you uncover here lays the foundation for smarter, more user-centered acquisition planning.


### Map the current state (as-is journey map)
The "As-Is" journey map captures how people currently experience a service from their point of view, across all channels (online, phone, paper, and in-person). This mapping process reveals the actual steps, delays, pain points, and workarounds that users encounter when interacting with a government process, policy, or digital tool. It builds shared understanding among team members and helps root future decisions in evidence.

Mapping the current state isn't just a documentation exercise; it is a discovery tool.
Journey maps reveal the gaps between how a service is intended to work and how it functions for real people navigating government systems.

### What is a journey map?
A journey map is a visual or narrative representation of a user's interaction with a service or product. It includes:
- Stages or steps in the process
- User actions
- Touchpoints (websites, forms, staff interactions, etc.)
- Emotions (frustration, confusion, relief)
- Pain points
- Opportunities for improvement

### Who should you map?
You may need separate maps for:
- External users (applicants, residents)
- Internal users (caseworkers, program staff, help desk agents)
- Multiple personas (first-time vs. repeat users, English vs. non-English speakers, low vs. high digital literacy)

### Steps to create an as-is journey map
1. Choose a Primary User Type or Persona
    - Focus on one user group at a time to avoid oversimplifying.
    - Example: “Single parent applying for government assistance.”
2. Define Start and End Points
    - What kicks off the journey (seeing a flyer, experiencing a life event)?
    - What is the user’s goal or desired outcome (receiving benefits, getting a confirmation)?
3. Document Each Step
    - How do they get information?
    - What forms do they fill out?
    - What systems do they touch?
    - Who do they talk to or rely on?
4. Capture Emotions and Friction
    - Where are users confused, frustrated, or delayed?
    - Where are they waiting, giving up, or re-entering the same information?
5. Include Backend/Staff Experience (Optional but valuable)
    - What happens behind the scenes at each user step?
    - Are there internal pain points, such as manual data entry or disconnected systems?
6. Highlight Pain Points and Insights
    - Call out moments where user needs aren’t met.
    - Note any workaround behavior (calling a helpline, submitting duplicate requests).
7. Use Visual Tools if Helpful
    - Use Mural, Miro, whiteboards, sticky notes, or flowcharts.
    - Color-code frustrations or break points for emphasis.

**Example**: for a benefits application process, the journey might look like this:

### Common pitfalls to avoid
- Only mapping the “happy path” and ignoring idealized versions, and focusing on real ones.
- Skipping internal workflows, these often reveal bottlenecks invisible to users.
- Overcomplicating the visual, keep it clear and action-oriented.
- Failing to revisit journey maps. Journey maps should evolve in response to new insights or changes in policy.

### Why it matters
Journey maps:
- Reveal root causes of failure (not just symptoms)
- Build empathy across stakeholders
- Uncover shared problems affecting both users and staff
- Shape meaningful scope in future PWS/SOO documents
- Set a baseline to measure improvement
