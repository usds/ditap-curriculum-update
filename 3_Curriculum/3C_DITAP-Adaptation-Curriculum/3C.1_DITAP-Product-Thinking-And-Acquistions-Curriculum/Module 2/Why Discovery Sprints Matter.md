# Why Discovery Sprints Matter 
The purpose of performing a discovery sprint BEFORE starting a project is to clarify scope, ensure the solution addresses real user and mission needs, and reduce risk. A discovery sprint prevents teams from building the wrong solution by ensuring they start with a clear, validated understanding of the right thing to build. From the [Discovery Sprint Guide](https://sprint.usds.gov/):

Discovery Sprints are short, 2 – 4 weeks, focused periods of research and exploration designed to understand the real needs of users and the context in which a service or system operates. A small cross-functional team of engineers, designers, product managers, procurement, and subject matter experts partner with program personnel to explore a problem or challenge. 

In the context of federal acquisitions, discovery sprints serve a critical role in shaping the scope of a Performance Work Statement (PWS) or Statement of Objectives (SOO) by ensuring it reflects actual problems, user needs, and operational realities, rather than assumptions.

Instead of writing a PWS based on internal preferences or outdated requirements, the discovery sprint helps teams clarify:
- Who the users are
- What they are trying to accomplish
- Where the friction points exist in the current system
- What success looks like for users and the agency

By grounding the scope in real-world findings, the resulting PWS becomes more targeted, relevant, and outcomes-focused. This improves the chances of acquiring a solution that users will adopt and that delivers a meaningful impact.

## How Discovery Sprints Inform Procurement
| Discovery Sprint Activity | Informs This Part of the PWS/SOO | 
| :---- | :---- |
| Problem statement definition | Purpose and background section |
| User interviews, journey maps | Current environment and pain points |
| Personas and stakeholder mapping | Key user groups and operational context |
| Identifying needs and constraints | Requirements and performance objectives |
| Success criteria discussion | Evaluation metrics or standards |

## Discovery Sprint Goals
Discovery Sprints help agencies **write the right requirements** by uncovering what truly needs to be solved. When integrated before drafting the PWS/SOO, they lead to better vendor alignment, clearly defined success measures, and more agile-friendly scopes of work.

- Understand the actual problem, not just the symptoms.
- Align stakeholders on the problem definition and success criteria.
- Identify user needs by conducting user research to understand how real people experience the issue.
- Map user journeys, pain points, goals, and success criteria to guide future design.
- Assess feasibility and constraints:
    - Legacy systems
    - Data availability
    - Policy barriers
    - Technical architecture
- Determine what is possible within the current constraints
    - Budget
    - Timeline
    - Infrastructure
    - Availability of government subject matter experts, product owners, engineers, etc.
- Define the proper scope by developing a problem statement, user personas, anda  prioritized list of needs and tasks to be done. 
- Set realistic expectations for what can and should be accomplished in early phases of the project.
- Create a shared understanding across cross-functional teams (business, technology, contracting, product, and design, etc.).
- Validate lightweight artifacts like draft roadmap, user stories, or initial hypotheses to test. 

## Discovery Sprint Steps
1. Define the problem statement
- Clarify what you're trying to learn or solve. Make it focused, user-centered, and grounded in mission outcomes.
    - Example: “How might we help residents understand and apply for childcare subsidies online?”
2. Identify stakeholders and user groups
- Map out everyone affected by the service, including both external stakeholders (e.g., residents, applicants) and internal stakeholders (e.g., program staff, call center agents, IT)
3. Conduct user research (quick and targeted)
- Interview or observe real users, if possible, or use proxies (such as frontline staff, support tickets, or analytics) to gather insights into user needs, pain points, and behaviors.
4. Create or update user personas
- Turn insights into representative personas that reflect your core user types. These guide design and prioritization later.
5. Map the current state (as-is journey map)
- Document how users currently experience the service or process, what works, where they get stuck, and what tools they use. Keep it high-level but grounded in evidence.
6. Identify pain points and opportunity areas
- Synthesize the research to spot high-friction steps, policy constraints, or technology barriers. These inform future ideation or procurements.
7. Define success criteria and next steps
- Align the team on what success looks like (e.g., shorter wait times, fewer dropped applications), and recommend next steps after the sprint (e.g., prototype, new PWS, policy change).
8. Share findings with stakeholders
- Deliver a concise report or briefing and include visuals, personas, and stories to help. Ensure that findings are actionable and tied to actual user needs.
