# Class Activity: Designing an Agile Evaluation Strategy

Now it’s your turn to design an agile evaluation strategy. Using your ESA scenario, draft a phased evaluation approach that reflects your team’s readiness and supports the goals of modern digital delivery. Focus on selecting a vendor who can collaborate, iterate, and solve real user problems, just like in the VA.gov case study.

Apply the principles of agile acquisition to develop a phased evaluation strategy for the procurement of the Emotional Support Animal (ESA) Registry. Your strategy should reflect your agency’s digital maturity, mission needs, and the practical realities of vendor evaluation in a federal context.

## Activity instructions:

### Scenario Setup: 
Your agency is preparing to acquire a modern, user-centered ESA Registry to support verification, renewals, and ongoing service delivery. Leadership supports agile methods, but your team is still building confidence and experience with agile evaluations. You understand the value of a down-select process but haven’t implemented one before.

### Your Task 
With your team, design a high-level evaluation strategy that prioritizes real-world vendor performance, not just well-written proposals. Your plan should reflect what you *need to see and test* to select a vendor capable of delivering iteratively and in collaboration with your team.

**1. Define Evaluation Phases**

* How many phases will your process include?  
* What will each phase consist of (e.g., case studies, written responses, team interviews, technical demonstrations)?  
* Which phases will be formally evaluated, and which will be informational or non-evaluated?

**2. Identify Evaluation Criteria**

* What capabilities or behaviors do you want to assess (e.g., agile practices, technical depth, user-centered design)?  
* How will you balance experience with past performance?

**3. Draft Proposal Instructions**

* What will you ask vendors to submit?  
* Will you require a live demonstration or working session?  
* How will you ensure instructions are clear, fair, and realistic for your evaluation team?

**4. Address Collaboration and Governance**

* How will you work with your Contracting Officer throughout the process?  
* What role will your team play in shaping the PWS or SOO?  
* How will you prepare your evaluation team to assess proposals and demos effectively?

### Deliverable

Prepare a short written summary of your proposed evaluation approach, including your rationale for structure, criteria, and process. Be ready to present key elements to the class.

### Activity Tip:  
Refer back to the [VA.gov Modernization Case Study](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3C_DITAP-Adaptation-Curriculum/3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquistions-Curriculum/Module%203/Artifact%3A%20VA.gov%20Modernization%20Case%20Study.md) for inspiration but ground your plan in your team’s current level of digital maturity and readiness. Your strategy doesn’t have to be perfect, it just needs to be intentional, actionable, and aligned with agile values.
