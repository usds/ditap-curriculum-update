# Class Activity: Estimating the Cost of Agile Delivery

In this activity, your team will build a draft **Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)** for your assigned ESA project scenario using the [**IGCE Tool**](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3C_DITAP-Adaptation-Curriculum/3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquistions-Curriculum/Module%200/Module%203%20-%20Activity%202%20-%20IGCE%20Template%20-%20Information.csv) tool. This exercise will help you connect the acquisition strategy (PWS or SOO) with the practical realities of pricing, labor planning, and delivery.

Your estimate should reflect both the current state of the project and the structure of the contract you chose in the prior activity. Think critically about what it will take to deliver value under agile conditions.

## Activity Instructions:

1. Stay with your original scenario team from the prior activity.  
2. Review your scenario (1, 2, or 3\) and your earlier decision (PWS or SOO).  
3. Open the Agile Team Estimator template provided.  
4. Work together to create a draft IGCE that accounts for:  
   * **Team composition:** What roles are needed (e.g., discovery, delivery, integration)?  
   * **Sprint length and number:** How long is each sprint? How many will you need?  
   * **Optional sprints:** Will you need contingency time for unknowns?  
   * **Other Direct Costs (ODCs):** Consider items like cloud services, translation, or security reviews.

**Deliverables**

* A completed IGCE using the Excel tool (including base and option periods).  
* A summary (1–2 paragraphs) that explains:  
  * How your IGCE reflect the needs of your scenario.  
  * How your PWS or SOO decision influenced your cost assumptions.

**Optional Team Share-Out:** Time permitting, teams may share highlights from their estimates and compare assumptions across scenarios.
