# Understanding Metrics in Agile IT Contracts 

## Tracking What Matters – Metrics That Support Agile Oversight and Delivery

As digital delivery begins, your role as a Product Owner (PO), Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR), or Product Manager (PM) doesn’t stop at kickoff. To ensure success, you’ll need to track progress from both a **contractual** and **product** lens.

This section helps you understand the difference between contract metrics and delivery metrics—why each matters, how they’re used, and how to avoid common missteps when interpreting agile data. By the end, you’ll be better equipped to evaluate vendor performance, support team learning, and focus on outcomes that matter to users—not just paperwork.

### **Two lenses: Oversight and product health**

**Contract metrics (oversight and compliance)**

*What they are:* Metrics that help you evaluate whether the vendor is meeting the **terms of the contract**—including timeliness, responsiveness, and documentation.

*Audience:* Primarily used by CORs, COs, and program oversight teams

**Examples:**

* On-time delivery of contract deliverables (e.g., sprint reports, demos)  
* Responsiveness to government feedback  
* Participation in required meetings or rituals  
* Documentation quality (e.g., compliance, security, accessibility)  
* Adherence to roles, hours, or team composition (in labor-hour contracts)  
* QASP ratings (quality, timeliness, communication)

*Why it matters:* These metrics ensure vendor accountability, protect government interests, and help you track whether the contractor is fulfilling what they were paid to deliver—even if the product itself still needs work.

**Delivery metrics (product health and team performance)**

*What they are:* Metrics that measure how well the **product is being delivered**, based on team behavior, user experience, and iterative progress.

*Audience:* Primarily used by Product Managers and Product Owners—but should be visible to CORs

**Examples:**

* Rate of rejected vs. accepted user stories  
* Defect or rework frequency  
* User satisfaction or usability feedback  
* Frequency of production deployments  
* Team morale or signs of burnout (surfaced in retrospectives)

*Why it matters:* Delivery metrics help teams continuously improve and stay focused on outcomes. A vendor could technically “comply” with a contract while still delivering a poor product. These metrics highlight whether the product is usable, functional, and improving over time.

### Why both types of metrics matter

|  | Contract Metrics | Delivery Metrics |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Main Question** | Are we complying with the contract? | Are we delivering value to users? |
| **Tracked In** | QASP, performance logs, vendor check-ins | Product dashboards, team retrospectives |
| **Tied To** | Payment, performance reviews, risk management | Learning, iteration, prioritization |
| **Owned By** | COR / CO | PO / PM – shared with the team |

### A word of caution on agile team metrics

Some agile tools—like velocity, burndown charts, and cycle time—are useful for team planning but **can be misleading** if misused in contract oversight.

| Metric | What It Measures | Use With Caution If… | Best Used For |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Velocity** | Story points completed per sprint | You’re using it to compare teams or judge contractor value | Tracking stable team pacing over time |
| **Burndown** | Progress toward sprint goals | You’re using it to assess performance or delivery accuracy | Adjusting sprint plans mid-sprint |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from work start to completion | You’re using it as a quality or productivity metric | Spotting delays or blockers in the workflow |

## Module 4 Recap: Managing Digital Service Delivery

Congratulations\! Your agile contract is underway. But remember: success is built over time, not awarded at signing. In this module, you explored how PMs, POs, and CORs guide agile delivery through daily decisions, collaboration, and user focus.

### Key takeaways

* **Agile delivery is a team sport.** Your role is not just oversight—it’s active participation in shaping outcomes.  
* **Delivery requires collaboration.** The PO owns the backlog, the COR ensures compliance, and the PM connects strategy to execution.  
* **Sprint issues happen.** What matters is how quickly you identify, communicate, and address them.  
* **Metrics matter—when used well.** Use contract metrics for accountability, delivery metrics for improvement, and connect the dots to make informed decisions.  
* **Product success is shared success.** Whether you’re the PO, PM, or COR, you contribute to outcomes that impact real people.

### Final module reflection

What’s one thing you’ll do differently the next time you support an agile delivery team?
