**Overview**

The National Office of Things & Stuff (NOTS) conducted a one-week discovery sprint to explore the development of a centralized Emotional Support Animal (ESA) registry. The goal was to understand how such a system could bring clarity and trust to a landscape currently dominated by unofficial websites, inconsistent policies, and widespread skepticism from landlords and service providers.

**Problem**

The sprint began by defining the core problem: individuals seeking official recognition for their emotional support animals face a confusing and unreliable ecosystem. ESA owners often encounter scam websites, unclear rules, and frequent challenges from those asked to honor ESA accommodations. The team identified key stakeholders, including ESA owners (such as veterans, students, and renters), landlords, transportation providers, mental health professionals, policy advisors, and animal welfare advocates.

**Stakeholders**

Several user personas were developed to capture these diverse perspectives. Maria, a renter with anxiety, needs her ESA to be accepted without being questioned. David, a property manager, desires a trustworthy method to verify ESA claims. Nia, a mental health provider, wants a streamlined, secure process for submitting ESA documentation. Their experiences helped the team visualize current user journeys and identify critical points of friction.

**Pain Points**

The current-state journey map revealed a disjointed experience. Users often begin by learning they need documentation, then search for answers online—only to find questionable or conflicting information. Many pay for unofficial certifications and later face rejection when presenting these materials to landlords or airlines. These findings highlighted key pain points, such as the absence of a centralized registry, the emotional toll of defending legitimate ESA needs, and a lack of integration between stakeholders.

**Opportunities**

From these insights, the team identified several opportunity areas. These include the creation of a secure, trustworthy national ESA registry; the development of verification tools for third parties; the standardization of documentation through provider channels; and the improvement of digital access and public guidance.

**Success Criteria**

To measure success, the team proposed several criteria: users should be able to register their ESA in under 10 minutes through a mobile-accessible platform; landlords and others should have a reliable verification method; documentation should follow national standards; and the official registry should clearly distinguish itself from fraudulent alternatives in search results.

**Next Steps**

The next steps include conducting further user interviews, analyzing the policy and regulatory environment, and drafting scope language for a prototype ESA registry platform. Legal and privacy review will also be necessary to ensure data protection compliance. Finally, findings from this sprint will be shared with leadership and acquisition teams to support further planning and investment.
