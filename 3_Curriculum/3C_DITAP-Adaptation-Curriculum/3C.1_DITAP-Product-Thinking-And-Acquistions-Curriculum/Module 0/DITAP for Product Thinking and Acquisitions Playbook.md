# DITAP Adaptation: DITAP for Product Thinking and Acquisitions 
DITAP for Product Thinking and Acquisitions is a streamlined adaptation introducing foundational product thinking tools and mindset.

## DITAP: Adaptation Purpose 
DITAP for Product Thinking and Acquisitions shifts participants from rigid procurement cycles to adaptive, iterative, and human-centered approaches, offering fast and actionable insights into how product management principles can reshape acquisition outcomes. This adaptation bridges the gap between digital service delivery and successful acquisition strategy, enabling smarter, user-aligned procurements and effective cross-functional collaboration. It strengthens the DITAP ecosystem by expanding its reach beyond formal roles, fostering a culture of product-minded problem solvers across government.

## Target Audience
Cross-functional federal staff responsible for shaping, managing, or influencing the delivery and acquisition of digital services. Ideal for federal professionals across acquisition and program delivery roles who:
- Are FAC-PM and FAC-COR certified professionals seeking to grow into more strategic roles, lead transformation efforts, and collaborate effectively with delivery teams.
- Influence or manage digital service procurements.
- Are not formal product managers, but need to collaborate with or understand product work.
- Are expected to champion user-centered and iterative approaches in digital transformation efforts.

## Delivery and Duration
This course is designed for maximum flexibility in both structure and delivery, meeting the needs of learners who operate in complex, fast-paced environments. Whether delivered virtually or in person, the curriculum emphasizes engagement, relevance, and modularity. This enables agencies to tailor the experience to meet their mission needs, staffing constraints, and delivery preferences.

### Format & Duration
The course contains five core modules, totaling approximately 24 hours of instruction. It can be delivered in multiple formats to accommodate agency schedules and learner availability:

- **Recommended Option 1: Three-Day Bootcamp**
    - Delivery: 3 full days, 8 hours each.
    - Best for: Immersive, in-person sessions or time-boxed virtual delivery.
    - Considerations: High intensity; requires strong facilitation and participant stamina.
- **Option 2: Modular Series**
    - Delivery: 8 sessions × 3 hours each over 2–4 weeks.
    - Best for: Spaced learning, lighter cognitive load, and integration with on-the-job responsibilities.
    - Considerations: Allows for reflection between sessions; requires consistent engagement tracking.

## Flexibility in Delivery
The course is fully adaptable for live virtual delivery, in-person workshops, or a blended model. Each session blends:
- Interactive facilitation (e.g., discussion, reflection, real-time collaboration).
- Self-paced elements (e.g., readings, templates, and activity prep between sessions).
- Case-based learning that scales to the group’s maturity level in digital service delivery or acquisitions.

## Instructional Considerations
- All modules include built-in activity transitions and minimal tech requirements to support low-friction movement between virtual and in-person formats.
- Slide decks, facilitator guides, and activity templates are designed to work seamlessly in tools like Zoom, Mural, Google Docs, or printed handouts.
- Session pacing is modular. Facilitators can re-sequence or collapse content based on group needs without losing learning coherence.
