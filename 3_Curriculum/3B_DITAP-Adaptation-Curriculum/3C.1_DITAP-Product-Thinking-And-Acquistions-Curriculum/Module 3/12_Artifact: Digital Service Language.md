# Artifact: Digital Service Language 

## Examples of Digital Services Language

### A. Agile and human-centered practices

* Adhere to the principles of the [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov), demonstrating familiarity with each play in design and delivery.
* Incorporate [Agile methodology](https://agilemanifesto.org/) into all work.
* Use iterative ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, retrospectives, and backlog refinement.
* Conduct and incorporate user research and usability testing.
* Involve end users in the design, building, and testing of all solutions.
* Incorporate personalization features where feasible and appropriate.

### B. Technical execution

* Design, develop, configure, customize, deploy, and operate all digital service solutions.
* Use continuous integration and delivery pipelines across all environments.
* Automate unit, integration, functional, and load testing.
* Strive for comprehensive test coverage of critical functionality, aiming for 100% where feasible.
* Use test-driven development (TDD) where appropriate.

### C. Accessibility and mobile optimization

* Optimize all products for mobile-first operation, ensuring usability across devices.
* Apply robust accessibility practices throughout design, development, and testing phases to meet Section 508 standards.

### D. Security and privacy

* Leverage existing agency-approved identity and authentication systems where appropriate.
* Exclude sensitive data from source code and store it securely in encrypted credential management systems.
* Apply best-in-class security practices and prioritize secure functionality, even where compliance may not yet mandate it.

### E. Open source and collaboration

* Deliver all code as Open Source Software in accordance with [OMB M-16-21](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf).
* Foster cooperative, transparent, and trust-based relationships with the government and other vendors.

## Human-Centered Design (HCD) Expectations in Scope Language

Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a foundational approach in digital services that ensures products are grounded in real user needs. Including HCD activities in your scope communicates to vendors that discovery, usability, and iteration are not optional, they are expected. These tasks help ensure the final product is useful, usable, and effective in supporting mission outcomes.

### A. HCD approach and collaboration

* Follow the U.S. Digital Service principle: “Design with users, not for them.”
* Provide expert guidance on user experience (UX) design strategy.
* Maintain thorough documentation for all HCD activities, recommendations, and decisions.
* Conduct product kick-off meetings with the Government Product Owner and key stakeholders at the start of new or existing work.

### B. User research

* Facilitate discovery research activities with users and stakeholders, including content, IA, accessibility, and business process reviews, plus analysis of existing analytics.
* Collaborate with other product teams to ensure alignment and avoid duplication.
* Conduct formative and contextual user research to understand goals, needs, and pain points.
* Define MVP functionality and translate findings into epics, user stories, and technical requirements.
* Perform routine usability testing throughout development.
* Conduct user acceptance testing, content reviews, IA/SEO reviews, and design assessments before release.
* Produce a UX Research Plan and Summary for each study, including methodology, synthesis, and next steps.

### C. Content and design

* Use iterative design process management, adjusting priorities based on user feedback.
* Write and edit plain language content aligned with federal standards.
* Maintain consistent information architecture (IA), including URLs, menus, navigation, and user flows.
* Deliver and test design artifacts like wireframes, prototypes, or web forms to support usability and agile development.
* Design to U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) standards and collaborate with the Government to propose new patterns as needed.
* Comply with all UX guidelines as outlined in [USWDS Website Standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/).

## Agile Development and Product Lifecycle Expectations

Modern digital service delivery is iterative, user-driven, and performance-focused. This section outlines how vendors are expected to plan, build, test, and continuously improve digital products in alignment with Agile best practices and federal digital service principles.

### I. Product planning and roadmap

* The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a Product Plan and Roadmap that serves as the authoritative reference for all planning, design, and performance tracking.
* The Product Plan shall include:
  * A description of the user problem being addressed.
  * Summaries of formative user research.
  * The team’s delivery approach.
  * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) developed in collaboration with the Product Owner and stakeholders.
  * Methods for evaluating performance against KPIs throughout the product’s lifecycle.

### II. Backlog and sprint management

* The Contractor shall maintain a continuously groomed backlog of work tied to validated user needs and supported by research artifacts.
* Each task in the backlog shall include:
  * Description of the user need.
  * Reference to relevant research or discovery artifacts.
  * Proposed solution approach.
  * Level-of-effort estimate.
* Before each sprint:
  * The Product Owner and stakeholders will prioritize backlog items and approve a Sprint Plan.
  * The Sprint Plan must define clear goals and acceptance criteria.
* During the sprint:
  * Teams may refine approaches as new information emerges, but acceptance criteria and effort levels remain fixed.
* After the sprint:
  * The Contractor shall conduct a Sprint Demonstration to validate functionality.
  * A Sprint Certification Package shall be submitted, including:
    * Summary of completed/incomplete work.
    * Issues encountered and resolutions.
    * Links to all deliverables and artifacts.
  * Approval by the Product Owner and COR is required before starting the next sprint.

### III. Common product lifecycle activities

**A. Discovery and research**
* Adhere to objectives outlined in the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov)
* Conduct discovery on:
  * Existing product features and architecture.
  * User journeys and stakeholder needs.
  * Business processes and data sources.
* Produce and maintain a Discovery Report summarizing findings.
* Partner with internal and external teams to ensure service integration and alignment.
* Use rapid prototyping to gather feedback before full development begins.

**B. Agile engineering practices**
* Define, develop, and test code that meets user and technical requirements.
* Use Agile, test-driven development (TDD), and pair programming where appropriate.
* Continuously integrate and deploy code:
  * Target daily production deployments.
  * Use lower environments for pre-release validation.
* Implement build, release, and deployment pipelines as version-controlled code.
* Maintain familiarity with agency tools (e.g., GitHub).
* Host code in public source repositories under OMB M-16-21 Open Source guidance.
* Integrate with relevant internal and external systems and document all integration points.
* Plan and document data migration strategies (e.g., from on-prem to cloud).

**C. Metrics and measurement**
* Define and track KPIs tied to user needs and problem statements.
* Establish baseline metrics to support continuous improvement.
* Use metrics to inform prioritization and roadmap adjustments.

**D. Collaboration and communication**
* Participate in stakeholder and planning meetings (virtual and in-person).
* Manage meeting documentation (agendas, minutes, action items).
* Support integrated, cross-functional teams that include both government and contractor staff.
* Share knowledge and lessons learned across the team.
* Maintain comprehensive documentation of:
  * Specifications
  * Design decisions
  * Data models
  * Dependencies
  * Architecture and systems integration details
