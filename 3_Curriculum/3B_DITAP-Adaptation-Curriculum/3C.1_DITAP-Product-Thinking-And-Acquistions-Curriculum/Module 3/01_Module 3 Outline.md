# Module 3 Outline: Agile Solicitations, Evaluation, and Award 
This module provides participants with essential knowledge and practical skills to implement agile acquisition strategies within the federal contracting environment. It begins by examining the foundational differences between a Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a Statement of Objectives (SOO), helping participants understand how each approach aligns with agile principles and human-centered design. Through this exploration, participants learn how to determine the most appropriate method based on the acquisition's goals and complexity, and how to draft these documents to foster flexibility, innovation, and user-focused outcomes in digital service procurements.

## Module Objectives: 
- Understand the difference between a Performance Work Statement (PWS) and a Statement of Objectives (SOO), and when to use each.
- Learn how to integrate agile and human-centered design principles into acquisition language.
- Practice developing an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for agile work.
- Explore modern evaluation methods like comparative analysis, demos, and down-selects.
- Design a high-level evaluation strategy for a fictional ESA registry procurement using real-world agile practices.
