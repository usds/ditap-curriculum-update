# From Discovery to Acquisition Strategy 

## Why Discovery Sets the Stage for Smarter Procurement
The discovery sprint serves as the critical foundation for an effective acquisition strategy by uncovering the real problems users face, identifying barriers to service delivery, and clarifying mission objectives. 

During the sprint, cross-functional teams gather qualitative and quantitative insights such as journey maps, service blueprints, user interviews, and technical constraints that help agencies understand the environment in which a solution must function. These findings are then used to inform the acquisition strategy, shifting the focus from predefined solutions to desired outcomes. Rather than issuing rigid, prescriptive requirements, the strategy becomes more flexible and responsive, allowing vendors to propose innovative approaches that meet validated user needs. 

Discovery also reveals operational and policy constraints, which help define the scope boundaries, evaluation criteria, and contract structure. Ultimately, the discovery sprint ensures that the acquisition is aligned with both real-world conditions and user-centered goals, increasing the likelihood of a successful, mission-driven implementation.

## Moving from Discovery Sprint to Acquisition Strategy

### Choosing the right contract structure: PWS or SOO?

As someone supporting or managing the acquisition of digital services, you may be asked to help determine whether a Performance Work Statement (PWS) or a Statement of Objectives (SOO) is the better fit for a given procurement. The right choice depends on what your team has learned during the discovery sprint and how involved your agency can be during the delivery process.

If user needs and technical constraints are well understood, a PWS may be a suitable option. But if there’s still ambiguity or if your agency wants to encourage vendors to propose innovative, outcome-driven solutions, a SOO provides greater flexibility. The key is to match the contract structure to the level of clarity, risk, and collaboration your team is ready to support.

### What agile contracting requires

Agile delivery is collaborative by design. It relies on regular engagement from both government and vendor teams throughout the lifecycle of the work, not just during planning or closeout. That means you, as a COR, program lead, or key acquisition advisor, play a critical role in shaping the outcomes.

Successful agile teams are cross-functional. They include contributions from the program side, the acquisition office, and often technical and user research leads. You don’t need to be a formal product manager. Still, you do need to understand how to support product thinking, staying involved, responding to new insights, and championing user-centered approaches from acquisition planning through contract execution.

### Key elements for agile success in government contracts
- **Agile development requires active participation** from both government personnel and contractors, it's a team sport.
- **Agency leaders must be prepared for hands-on involvement** from roles that may not traditionally engage deeply during execution.
- **Successful agile teams are cross-functional**, with representatives from both the program and acquisition offices.

**How to Decide?**

As a federal acquisition or program professional, use the following diagnostic questions to assess whether a PWS or SOO is more appropriate, based on what your team has learned through discovery and how ready your agency is to support iterative delivery.

### Discovery sprint-based questions
1. Do we have a clear understanding of the problem and user needs?
    - *Yes* → PWS *may* be appropriate.
    - *No or partial* → SOO preferred (lets vendors propose solutions).
2. Do we already know what the solution should look like or what it should do?
    - *Yes* (e.g., “Build an online form using X tool”) → PWS.  
    - *No* (e.g., “Users are failing to apply because the process is too confusing”) → SOO.
3. Did the discovery sprint produce concrete, testable outcomes?
    - *If yes* → Can use in either format (SOO objectives or PWS deliverables).  
    - *If no* → Might need to allow for continued discovery, favoring SOO.
4. Are we still uncertain about technical constraints, integration points, or policy requirements?
    - *Yes* → SOO allows vendor flexibility and iteration.  
    - *No* → PWS is more manageable with a fixed scope.

### Team capacity and engagement questions
1. Do we have a dedicated product owner or SME available during delivery?
    - *Yes* → SOO is viable (government team helps steer the work).  
    - *No* → PWS may be safer (vendor follows more explicit instructions).
2. Can our team provide feedback frequently and make quick decisions?
    - *Yes* → SOO supports collaborative, agile-style delivery.  
    - *No* → PWS reduces dependency on gov-side responsiveness.
3. Are we prepared to evaluate proposals based on approach, not just price?
    - *Yes* → SOO allows creative responses and should be evaluated accordingly.  
    - *No* → PWS with clear evaluation criteria may be better.

### Contract management and risk questions
1. Do we need to control how the work is done (due to compliance, security, etc.)?
    - *Yes* → PWS.  
    - *No* → SOO provides vendor autonomy.
2. Is the project high-risk or high-visibility, requiring flexibility and learning?
    - *Yes* → SOO preferred to avoid premature solution lock-in. 
    - *No* → PWS acceptable if risks are well understood.
3. Are we open to modular or phased delivery (discovery → alpha → beta → live)?
    - *Yes* → SOO supports iterative planning.
    - *No* → A more detailed PWS might be appropriate.

**Decision Tip:**
- *If clarity is high and flexibility is low → PWS*  
- *If clarity is low and flexibility is high → SOO*

## Government Agile Maturity: Why It Matters

In digital service acquisitions, the success of agile delivery doesn’t just depend on contractors; it depends on the **readiness of the government team** to collaborate, adapt, and lead. Product Managers and CORs play a critical role in making iterative delivery work. Knowing your agency's level of Agile maturity helps you choose the appropriate contract structure, manage risk effectively, and set realistic expectations with vendors.

### Key readiness indicators:
- **Agile literacy:**
    - Are team members familiar with agile principles, user stories, sprints, backlogs, MVPs, etc.?
- **Product ownership:**
    - Is there a dedicated, empowered Product Owner who can make decisions quickly?
- **COR engagement:**
    - Does the COR understand iterative delivery and how to monitor vendor performance in agile environments?
- **User involvement:**
    - Can the team support ongoing user research and usability testing?
- **Organizational support:**
    - Are leadership, legal, and finance teams open to modular delivery and flexible scope?

Agencies that recognize their current level of agile maturity and communicate it transparently reduce procurement risk and create better outcomes. This is not about being perfect. It is about being honest, aligned, and ready to grow.

### Assessing Agile Team Maturity
Understanding an Agile team’s maturity helps determine how much structure, support, and flexibility to include in a contract. Teams with higher maturity are equipped to deliver iteratively, manage evolving user needs, and work independently, while less mature teams may require more guidance and oversight.

Key indicators of Agile maturity include:
- **Team Composition**:
    - Cross-functional team with clearly defined roles (e.g., Product Owner, Scrum Master, developers, designers).
- **Process Discipline**:
    - Regularly conducts Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, retrospectives, and demos.
- **User Engagement**:
    - Actively involves users in research, testing, and feedback loops.
- **Delivery Cadence**:
    - Produces working, testable software at the end of each sprint.
- **Backlog Health**:
    - Maintains a well-groomed, prioritized backlog informed by research.
- **Performance Awareness**:
    - Uses metrics to drive delivery improvements and product decisions.

Depending on the government team’s Agile readiness, whether **novice**, **intermediate**, or **expert**, the contract should be tailored to fill gaps in knowledge, capacity, or process maturity. 

For example:

- Novice teams may need vendors to provide Agile coaching, facilitate ceremonies, and scaffold user research activities.
- Intermediate teams might benefit from embedded product advisors, lightweight templates (e.g., User Research Plan, Sprint Plan, Backlog Item, etc.), or vendor-led user testing with government participation.
- Expert teams often prefer leaner contracts that emphasize outcomes, rapid delivery, and deep technical integration without prescriptive process support.

In this activity, you’ll step into the role of an acquisition team preparing to procure a digital service, in this case, a centralized ESA registration system. Based on a project scenario and delivery sprint report, your team will determine whether a Performance Work Statement (PWS) or a Statement of Objectives (SOO) is the more suitable option for the procurement. You’ll use discovery-informed criteria to guide your decision and provide a short justification for your recommendation. Either outcome is acceptable, as long as your reasoning aligns with the scenario conditions and supports agile delivery. By the end of this activity, you’ll better understand how discovery insights shape contract structure, and how your choice impacts vendor flexibility, delivery risk, and mission outcomes.
