# The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)

## Creating a Cost Estimate 
When creating a cost estimate for Agile software development under a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract, it’s essential to understand that Agile is priced differently than traditional (waterfall) approaches.

In traditional contracts, payments are tied to predefined features or deliverables. In Agile, work adapts over time in response to user needs. Instead of paying for a finished list of features, you’re investing in a skilled team that delivers working software continuously in short development cycles.

### What are you paying for in Agile?
Under an Agile FFP contract, the deliverable is not a final system; it is the process of producing high-quality, working software, one sprint at a time. These sprints (or iterations) typically last 2–4 weeks and deliver usable features based on current priorities.

Agile emphasizes team-based delivery over tracking individual hours. Therefore, cost estimates should reflect the team’s capacity and performance over time, not detailed time sheets or fixed feature lists.

### How to estimate a Firm Fixed Price Per Iteration
When building your Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) for an Agile contract, use the following core elements. These help define the structure, scale, and duration of the work being priced.

**Key agile pricing factors**
- Team Size: 6–12 full-time employees (FTEs) per Agile team.
- Number of Teams: Based on scope, deadlines, and budget.
- Iteration Type(s): Discovery, Development, Envisioning, or Hybrid.
- Iteration Length: Typically 2–4 weeks.
- Period of Performance: Usually 6–12 months.
- Incentives: Consider Award Fees or Award Terms to reward strong performance.

**Deciding How Many Teams You Need**</br>
Ask these two questions:
- Are there fixed deadlines for releasing key features?
- Can parts of the system be developed simultaneously (in parallel)?</br>
If the answer to either is yes (and funding allows), consider using multiple small Agile teams. It's best to keep each team to 12 people or fewer for efficiency and agility.

**Tip**: Pre-defining too many of these elements (like team size or estimation method) can limit how vendors tailor their solutions. Allow some flexibility for innovation.

**Team Composition Notes**

Not every role requires a full-time commitment. Agile teams often share responsibilities or have members perform multiple roles.


### Offerors should clearly describe their proposed team structure and how it supports delivery

**Sample CLIN Structure**</br>
- **Base Period**: 6 months
- **CLIN 0001**
- **Iteration Length**: 2 weeks
- **Total Iterations**: 13
- **Price per Iteration**: $ 209,600
- **Number of Teams**: 1
- **Total Firm Fixed Price**: $ 2,724,800

## IGCE – Agile Team Estimator
The IGCE Agile Team Estimator is a practical tool designed to help teams develop accurate Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCEs) for Agile projects.

[View the IGCE Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-4_YvhplWhIyl09KnlK-AT4fexjBdPXAw4FiqZRWDA/edit?usp=sharing)

The **IGCE Agile Team Estimator** is a flexible, user-friendly tool designed to help teams develop accurate Independent Government Cost Estimates (IGCEs) for Agile contracts.
- The Team Planner tab is fully customizable for each contract, allowing users to select labor categories from a convenient dropdown menu.
- The tool automatically calculates the price per sprint based on the team composition, sprint duration, and total number of sprints.
- It includes fields for Other Direct Costs (ODCs) and can account for optional tasks by calculating the cost of additional sprints.
- The Summary page can be adjusted to reflect input from multiple team tabs, allowing for coordinated cost planning across several Agile teams and multiple periods of performance.
- This estimator supports streamlined planning and promotes consistency in Agile IGCE development.

## Class Activity: [Estimating the Cost of Agile Delivery](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3C_DITAP-Adaptation-Curriculum/3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquistions-Curriculum/Module%203/Class%20Activity%3A%20Estimating%20the%20Cost%20of%20Agile%20Delivery.md)
In this activity, you will create a draft [Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d-4_YvhplWhIyl09KnlK-AT4fexjBdPXAw4FiqZRWDA/edit?usp=sharing) for the ESA registration project scenario your team analyzed earlier. Working with the Agile Team Estimator tool, your team will translate project-specific factors such as delivery method, team composition, timeline, and contract structure into a realistic, agile-informed cost estimate.

Your IGCE should reflect the conditions outlined in your assigned scenario and the decision your team made in the PWS or SOO Activity. Consider how agile delivery impacts pricing assumptions, labor mix, and risk management, and how your estimate will help inform the acquisition planning process.
By the end of this activity, you will strengthen your ability to scope, structure, and justify agile digital service costs in a way that aligns with discovery insights and supports mission outcomes.
