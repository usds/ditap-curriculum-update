# Shifting the Mindset: From Compliance to Collaboration 

## You Have Been Awarded the Contract - Now the Real Work Begin. 

Once a contract is awarded, the real work of delivering value begins. As a Product Manager (PM), Product Owner (PO), or Contracting Officer‚Äôs Representative (COR), your role is essential to ensuring that delivery stays focused on user needs and mission outcomes and not just contract compliance. In agile digital service delivery, success depends on active, collaborative engagement across these roles.

This module explores how to lead and support that success. You‚Äôll learn how to move beyond traditional oversight toward shared accountability, product thinking, and real-time responsiveness. Whether you're unblocking a team, monitoring delivery metrics, or aligning stakeholders, your ability to show up as a strategic partner will shape what gets delivered and how well it works for users.

## Your Role in Agile Contract Execution

In an agile contract environment, your role extends far beyond checking boxes or ensuring compliance. You are helping deliver real, working tools that meet real user needs. This requires continuous delivery, iteration, and collaboration and not just oversight. As a PM, PO, or COR, you play a key role in managing risk while ensuring the team has what it needs to succeed.

Each role contributes a distinct, essential perspective:

* **The Product Owner (PO)** prioritizes what gets built and why.  
* **The Contracting Officer‚Äôs Representative (COR)** ensures delivery aligns with contract terms and protects the government‚Äôs interests.  
* **The Product Manager (PM)** keeps the mission in focus, connects the dots across teams, and champions user needs.

Together, you form a **triangle of trust and delivery** balancing product, performance, and procurement.

## How It Works: Key Roles in Post-Award Execution

### Product Owner (PO)

The PO manages the day-to-day decisions that shape the product. They serve as the voice of the user and work closely with the vendor team to ensure the right things are being delivered and delivered well.

**Key responsibilities:**

* Own and prioritize the product backlog.  
* Make real-time decisions about scope and tradeoffs.  
* Accept or reject completed work based on the Definition of Done.  
* Engage users to validate features and gather feedback.  
* Maintain open communication between vendor and government teams.

The PO is your product expert on the ground, guiding delivery in real time.

### Contracting Officer‚Äôs Representative (COR)

The COR ensures that contract terms are met and that delivery is responsible, timely, and aligned with expectations. They act as the contractual bridge between the delivery team and procurement office.

**Key responsibilities:**

* Monitor vendor performance (quality, timeliness, communication).  
* Document findings for performance records and oversight (e.g., QASP).  
* Collaborate with the PO to align work with contract goals.  
* Identify and elevate risks or issues affecting scope or compliance.  
* Notify the CO when action is needed on scope, funding, or legal concerns.

The COR ensures that agile delivery remains compliant and protects the government's investment.

### Product Manager (PM)

The PM leads with a strategic lens‚Äîconnecting user needs, agency goals, delivery work, and contract structure. They help the team maintain focus on outcomes that matter.

**Key responsibilities:**

* Define and communicate the product vision and mission priorities.  
* Support the PO in prioritization and tradeoff decisions.  
* Align the team with broader agency strategies and user goals.  
* Coordinate across leadership, delivery, and acquisition stakeholders.  
* Identify delivery risks early and escalate when necessary.

The PM ensures the product stays aligned with the mission and continues to deliver value throughout its lifecycle.

## Getting Started Right: Laying the Groundwork for Agile Delivery 

Before sprint work begins, it‚Äôs essential to align your team around a shared vision and a clear operating framework. Early coordination between the government and vendor teams helps reduce confusion, surface risks, and build momentum.

Start by co-creating the delivery environment:

* Clarify roles and expectations across all team members, including Product Owner (PO), Contracting Officer‚Äôs Representative (COR), vendors, and stakeholders.  
* Draft a simple **project charter** or **communications plan** to guide decision-making and collaboration.  
* Establish regular touchpoints and delivery rituals (e.g., standups, sprint reviews, risk check-ins) to support continuous feedback and course correction.

As you launch the project, consider the following questions:

* What does the PO need to make informed product decisions?  
* What should the COR track and document to monitor performance?  
  Who is responsible for delivery decisions‚Äîand when should they escalate issues?  
* What does ‚Äúdone‚Äù look like, and how will you know you‚Äôre on track?

üîç **Tip:** Use the [Sample Project Charter](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3C_DITAP-Adaptation-Curriculum/3C.1_DITAP-Product-Thinking-And-Acquistions-Curriculum/Module%204/Artifact%3A%20Digital%20Service%20Project%20Charter.md) to help you align your team and set shared expectations from Day 1\.
