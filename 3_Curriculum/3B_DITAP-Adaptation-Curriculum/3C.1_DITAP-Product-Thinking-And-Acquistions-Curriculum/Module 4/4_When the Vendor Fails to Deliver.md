# When the Vendor Fails to Deliver 

Agile delivery doesn't guarantee smooth sailing. Even strong teams can miss deadlines, deliver incomplete work, or fail to meet expectations. When things go off track, it‚Äôs critical that the Product Owner (PO) and Contracting Officer‚Äôs Representative (COR) respond quickly, collaboratively, and within the scope of their roles.

This section outlines how delivery and oversight roles respond to performance issues, along with examples of common challenges and questions to support continuous improvement.

## The Role of the Product Owner (PO)

### Focus: Delivery leadership

The PO owns the product backlog, prioritizes work, and ensures alignment with user needs and mission outcomes. While they don‚Äôt manage the contract, they are accountable for ensuring that the product delivers value.

### What the PO can do:

* **Reject Incomplete Work:** If sprint deliverables don‚Äôt meet the Definition of Done, the PO can reject them during the Sprint Review. Rejected work is returned to the backlog for rework or re-prioritization.
* **Clarify Requirements or Priorities:** Delivery issues may result from misalignment. The PO can work with the team to clarify stories, adjust scope, or reorder the backlog.
* **Assess Team Dynamics:** Use the retrospective to surface delivery risks, gaps in ownership, or velocity concerns.
* **Communicate Early and Often:** Alert the COR and stakeholders to emerging concerns, don‚Äôt wait until sprint close-out.
* **Escalate Delivery Risks:** When patterns of failure emerge, document them and alert the COR for possible contract-level intervention.

üîç **PO takeaway:** The PO addresses delivery from a product and team perspective. They don‚Äôt manage contracts but are critical in diagnosing and documenting why delivery is off track.

## The Role of the COR

### Focus: Oversight and compliance

The COR ensures that the vendor meets contractual obligations and that performance is well-documented and legally defensible. They represent the government‚Äôs interests while helping delivery stay on track.

### What the COR can do:

* **Document the Issue:** Use tools like the QASP or a performance log to record missed deliverables, quality concerns, or communication breakdowns.
* **Coordinate with the CO:** For persistent or contractual issues, notify the Contracting Officer. Only the CO can take formal action (e.g., issuing a Cure Notice or modifying the contract).
* **Facilitate a Corrective Action Plan:** Work with the PO and CO to request a vendor plan outlining improvements, staffing adjustments, or revised timelines.
* **Monitor Remediation:** Track follow-through on the corrective plan and escalate if issues remain unresolved.
* **Support Formal Remedies (if needed):** If remediation fails, provide documentation that supports next steps, payment withholds, task order termination, or past performance action.

üîç **COR takeaway:** The COR addresses delivery failure from a contractual and performance perspective. They ensure the government stays protected while giving vendors fair opportunity to course correct.

## Working Together: PO and COR Collaboration

Although the PO and COR operate under different authorities, they should remain tightly aligned throughout delivery. Together, they can:
* Share sprint notes and backlog context.  
* Document issues collaboratively.  
* Elevate concerns to vendor leadership.  
* Jointly escalate risks to the CO when needed.

## Common Issues in Agile Sprints

Agile projects are iterative, but certain challenges tend to repeat. Here are the most common ones across four categories:

### Delivery and execution issues

| Issue | Example | Why It Matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Missed Deliverables | Vendor commits to 5 stories but only delivers 2 | Affects product momentum and may signal overcommitment or poor planning |
| Poor Quality | Delivered code has bugs or fails basic usability checks | Impacts user experience and can lead to costly rework |
| Incomplete Work | Features are partially done, but still demoed as ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù | Misrepresents progress and misaligns with Definition of Done |
| Lack of Test Coverage | No automated tests or validation included | Increases long-term risk of instability and regression issues |

### Process and communication issues

| Issue | Example | Why It Matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Unclear Acceptance Criteria | PO and vendor interpret user stories differently | Leads to rework and inconsistent product outcomes |
| Poor Backlog Grooming | Team enters sprint with vague or oversized stories | Sprint is inefficient, and priorities may drift |
| Missed Standups or Rituals | Vendor team skips daily standup or retrospective | Reduces transparency, limits collaboration, delays problem solving |
| Stakeholder Misalignment | Stakeholders expect feature X, but team delivers feature Y | Indicates failure to engage users or validate assumptions |

### Team dynamics and capacity issues

| Issue | Example | Why It Matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Team Burnout | Velocity drops due to overwork or unclear goals | Unsustainable pace affects morale and delivery quality |
| Key Staff Turnover | Vendor loses a lead developer mid-sprint | Disrupts team continuity and requires fast replanning |
| Poor Vendor Collaboration | Vendor doesn‚Äôt respond to PO or ignores feedback | Signals lack of trust or contract misunderstanding |

### Contractual and oversight issues

| Issue | Example | Why It Matters |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Misaligned Scope | Work delivered doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs in the contract | Puts the government at risk for non-compliant or unauthorized work |
| Performance Not Tracked | No sprint-level documentation by COR | Limits ability to evaluate vendor or apply corrective action later |
| Change Not Communicated | PO changes backlog priorities without notifying COR | Causes confusion and undermines shared accountability |
| Overstepping Boundaries | COR or PO directs contractor beyond their authority | Could result in unauthorized commitments or scope creep |

## Early Warning Signs of Escalation

* Sprint velocity drops two cycles in a row.  
* Repeated delivery without user testing or feedback.  
* Defensive or evasive vendor behavior in retrospectives.  
* Government receives complaints from users or stakeholders.  
* Contractual deliverables (e.g., accessibility, documentation) are consistently missing.

## Investigating Issues: Asking the Right Questions

**1. Clarify the nature of the issue**

* Was this a planning issue, a delivery problem, or an external blocker?  
* Were any warnings flagged during sprint planning or standups?  
* How did this compare to past velocity?

**2. Assess team communication**

* Were acceptance criteria clear and agreed upon?  
* Were there missed check-ins or misunderstood expectations?  
* Did the vendor understand the sprint priorities?

**3. Identify external or human factors**

* Were there personal emergencies or system outages?  
* Was there a delay in getting approvals or access to data?

## When It‚Äôs an Unforeseen Blocker

### What the PO can do:

* Reprioritize the backlog and flag delayed stories.  
* Use retrospectives to adjust expectations.  
* Ask the vendor what support is needed.

### What the COR can do:

* Document the disruption clearly.  
* Determine if it‚Äôs a one-time issue or pattern.  
* Avoid penalizing for true emergencies, but monitor for trends.

üîç **Important note:** Agile allows flexibility but not ambiguity. Always document what changed and why.

## When Issues Become a Pattern

If problems repeat across multiple sprints:

* Request a formal **Corrective Action Plan** through the CO  
* Increase check-in frequency.  
* Consider additional contract guardrails (e.g., interim checkpoints).  
* Revisit your QASP for clarity and shared expectations.

## Sample Questions for Retrospective or Standup Check-Ins

| For PO | For COR |
| :---- | :---- |
| ‚ÄúWhat surprised us in this sprint?‚Äù | ‚ÄúWere any contractual deliverables missed or unclear?‚Äù |
| ‚ÄúDid we overestimate our capacity?‚Äù | ‚ÄúWas this a quality issue or a timeline issue?‚Äù |
| ‚ÄúWere blockers surfaced early enough?‚Äù | ‚ÄúShould this be escalated to the CO for scope/funding/schedule adjustment?‚Äù |
| ‚ÄúDo we need to revise the Definition of Done?‚Äù | ‚ÄúDoes this affect QASP ratings or performance documentation?‚Äù |
