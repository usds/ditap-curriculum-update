* Attends agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, retrospectives, and demos.  
* Provides ongoing feedback and acceptance of delivered work.  
* Collaborates closely with the vendor team and COR to assess delivery risks.  
* Maintains documentation of user needs, product vision, and success metrics.

### Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) – Oversight and performance

* Monitors contractor performance and alignment with contract terms.  
* Participates in sprint reviews and observes contractor team engagement.  
* Maintains sprint-level performance observations for QASP input.  
* Raises potential issues early and works with CO/PO on resolutions.  
* Supports retrospective and evaluation activities.

### Contracting Officer (CO) – Acquisition strategy and governance

* Oversees contractual compliance and administration.  
* Works with the COR and PO to remove acquisition-related roadblocks.  
* Participates in procurement-focused retrospectives and touchpoints.  
* Provides decision-making on contract scope, modifications, or escalations.  
* Helps maintain alignment between procurement strategy and delivery success.

## Communication Cadence & Decision-Making

*Meeting | Participants | Frequency | Purpose*

* CO/COR/PO Baseline Check-ins | CO, COR, PO | Bi-weekly (first 3 months) | Review sprint performance, team health, delivery alignment, and clarify roles as delivery ramps up.  
* Ongoing Performance Syncs | CO, COR, PO | Monthly (after Month 3\) | Monitor trends, address emerging risks, review progress toward goals.  
* Procurement Retrospective | CO, COR, PO | Quarterly | Reflect on procurement process effectiveness, review delivery performance, and propose improvements.  
* Sprint Reviews | COR, PO, Vendor Team | Every sprint | Review delivered work, observe collaboration, track team progress.

### Performance monitoring and documentation  
The COR and PO will jointly observe and document contractor performance at the end of each sprint. Observations will include quality of work, responsiveness, collaboration, and alignment with priorities. These notes will be used to inform the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) and past performance documentation for future acquisitions. Observations will also support discussions during procurement retrospectives and potential contract modifications.

### Issue escalation process
When issues arise (e.g., delays, misaligned delivery, non-performance), the team will:

* Raise the concern during regular touchpoints or asynchronously via agreed communication channels.  
* Collaboratively identify the root cause and propose corrective actions.  
* Document the decision or next steps.  
* Escalate to agency leadership or vendor executives if needed.

### Celebrating success 
To promote a healthy team culture and recognize progress:

* The CO, COR, and PO will acknowledge milestone achievements during touchpoints.  
* Sprint demos and reviews will include feedback and “what went well” moments.  
* Team wins (e.g., user value delivered, problems solved) will be documented for internal knowledge sharing and morale.
