# Agile Rituals Meet Federal Oversight 

## Working Together in Agile Delivery: Supporting Product, Not Just Process

Agile delivery in government works best when everyone involved Product Owners (POs), Contracting Officer’s Representatives (CORs), Contracting Officers (COs), and Product Managers (PMs) is engaged, aligned, and responsive. It’s not just about managing scope or tracking compliance; it’s about co-creating useful, working tools that deliver real value to the public.

## Agile Rituals and Who’s Involved

Agile delivery runs on a steady rhythm of short cycles and continuous feedback. Here’s what a typical one-month sprint cycle might look like in a federal digital services project, along with the key players and purpose of each activity:

| Agile Ritual | Who’s Involved | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Sprint Planning | PO, COR, PM, Vendor | Aligns scope and priorities for the next sprint |
| Daily Standups | PO, Development Team | Identifies blockers and shares quick updates |
| Sprint Review | PO, COR, CO, PM | Reviews working software and confirms alignment |
| Sprint Retrospective | PO, COR, PM, Vendor | Improves team dynamics and process effectiveness |
| Monthly Check-In | COR, CO, PM | Reviews performance and addresses contract needs |

⚠️ **Reminder**: Your presence and participation help spot issues early and build shared accountability across roles.

### Why your involvement matters

In traditional contracts, feedback often comes too late typically in quarterly reviews or after issues have already escalated. In agile delivery, your active participation ensures that:

* Feedback loops are fast and frequent.  
* Risks are surfaced early and addressed collaboratively.  
  Success is measured not just by checkboxes, but by working software and real user outcomes.

You're not just managing a contract, you're helping steward a product into the world. That means focusing on **how well it works for users**, not just whether it matches the initial SOW.

### Supporting momentum and measuring success

Success in digital service delivery is dynamic. Instead of waiting for final deliverables, teams should:

* Celebrate early wins.  
* Show usable outcomes regularly.  
* Flag risks and blockers quickly, with context.  
* Reflect, adapt, and continuously improve together.

This culture of transparency, feedback, and iteration is what keeps agile teams aligned and effective.

### You are on the team

As a COR, PM, or PO, you are not a passive overseer, you are a **critical part of the team**. Your insight and involvement help:

* Maintain clarity around goals and scope.  
* Remove obstacles before they derail delivery.  
* Foster trust and collaboration across roles.

Digital delivery succeeds when procurement and program teams work together, not in silos.

### How agile aligns with procurement oversight

To show how agile practices map to federal oversight roles, here’s an example one-month delivery rhythm that aligns ceremonies with key oversight responsibilities:

**One-month agile sprint cycle example (2-week sprints)**

**Pre-sprint activities (Before week 1 and week 3\)**  
 Participants: Vendor team, PO, COR (observer), technical stakeholders  
 Activities:

* **User Story Sizing**: Vendor team and PO review upcoming stories and estimate effort.  
* **Backlog Refinement**: PO re-prioritizes tasks based on team velocity and mission priorities.  
* **Definition of Done Review**: Clarifies expectations and ensures alignment before development begins.

By setting a steady cadence and clear roles early, federal teams create the foundation for agile success, one sprint at a time.

## Product Management and Procurement Alignment

Agile delivery isn’t just about building software, it’s about ensuring that delivery activities are supported by clear oversight, measurable expectations, and early risk detection. That’s where strong collaboration between Product Owners (POs), Contracting Officer’s Representatives (CORs), and the broader procurement team becomes essential.

Below illustrates how key agile ceremonies map to procurement oversight responsibilities, showing where alignment is critical to success.

### Sprint planning: Understanding scope before work begins

**What happens**  

The development team and PO meet to plan the sprint. Stories are selected from the backlog, scoped, and committed to by the team.

**Procurement alignment**

* The COR attends to observe planned work, identify complexity, and assess potential risks.  
* The PO and COR document sprint goals, caveats, and key assumptions, establishing a shared baseline for tracking performance. 
* Early warning signs (e.g., ambiguous requirements or resourcing constraints) can be flagged and escalated to the Contracting Officer (CO) if needed.

**Why it matters**  

Sprint planning ensures the team is aligned not only on what they’re building, but also on what the contract supports. This shared understanding prevents missteps and builds a foundation for accountability.

### Sprint review: Demonstrating what was delivered

**What happens**  

At the end of each sprint, the vendor demonstrates completed work, ideally working software or tangible features.

**Procurement alignment**

* The PO evaluates whether the work meets the **Definition of Done (DoD)**.  
* The COR reviews deliverables for quality, completeness, and alignment with contract expectations.  
* This review informs **Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)** documentation and performance records.

**Why it matters**  

The sprint review is a critical checkpoint, it verifies that outcomes meet expectations and supports timely, informed performance oversight.

### Sprint retrospective: reflecting and improving

**What happens**  

The team (including vendor, PO, and often the COR) reflects on what worked well, what didn’t, and what to improve in future sprints.

**Procurement alignment**

* The COR can observe or contribute, capturing insights into team dynamics, recurring blockers, or delivery challenges.  
* These insights support vendor evaluations and help surface issues before they affect outcomes.

**Why it matters**  

Retrospectives aren’t just about team processes; they provide valuable context for understanding vendor performance beyond binary success metrics, and they can surface how government actions, decisions, or delays may be impacting progress.

### Stakeholder feedback sessions: Bringing in broader voices

**What happens** 

Roughly once a month, additional agency stakeholders are invited to see progress, ask questions, and share input.

**Procurement alignment**

* The PO and COR use this feedback to assess whether the product is meeting broader user and mission needs.  
* Stakeholder input helps refine sprint goals, identify misalignments, and shape what comes next.

**Why it matters**  

Feedback from real users and partners keeps delivery focused on what matters most, solving the right problems, not just following the right process.
