# Facilitator Guide: Discovery Sprint Labs
For Product Managers and Contracting Officer’s Representatives (CORs).

## Overview and purpose
Digital services often fail when teams assume too much and learn too late. This three-part lab simulates a **lightweight discovery sprint** tailored for government environments, helping participants:
* Focus on real user needs and not assumptions.  
* Understand policy, technical, and operational constraints.  
* Align product decisions and acquisitions to mission outcomes.

These labs provide hands-on experience with tools and mindsets introduced throughout the course, culminating in outputs that can inform real-world procurement activities.

## Course connection
This lab reinforces key concepts from earlier modules:
* **Module 1: Digital services and why product thinking matters in government**  
  - Practice user-centered, iterative thinking in a cross-functional team.  
* **Module 2: Understanding problems and people**  
  - Apply techniques like stakeholder interviews, journey mapping, and defining success criteria.  
* **Module 3: Agile solicitations, evaluation, and award**  
   - Convert discovery findings into usable inputs for a SOO/PWS or evaluation strategy.  
* **Module 4: Managing digital delivery**   
  - Understand how good discovery work sets the foundation for performance.

## Alignment to acquisition lifecycle

The outputs from this lab can directly support:
* **Market research and requirements development**  
  Discovery outputs feed a meaningful SOO or PWS.
* **Acquisition strategy**  
  Clear understanding of what outcomes matter and what constraints exist.
* **Proposal evaluation planning**  
  User needs and success criteria help define what “good” looks like.

## Learning objectives

* **Apply a product mindset** to early-stage problem framing.  
  * Focus on the *problem*, not the solution.  
* **Conduct self-directed research** to uncover user needs, policy drivers, and technical constraints.  
  * Utilize discovery techniques, including stakeholder interviews, reviewing existing documentation, and analyzing current systems and processes.→ Learn to ask meaningful questions, identify significant patterns, and make informed decisions even when information is incomplete.  
* **Identify and prioritize user needs, mission drivers, and environmental constraints.**  
  * Translate raw observations into structured insights that guide design and acquisition.  
*  **Capture findings in acquisition-aligned format.**  
   * Document key insights as usable inputs for a Statement of Objectives (SOO), Performance Work Statement (PWS), or evaluation criteria.  
*   **Collaborate in a cross-functional team.**  
    - Experience the dynamics of working with researchers, technologists, SMEs, and acquisition professionals.

## How to facilitate

**Format:** Each lab follows a guided, participant-driven structure with teamwork time, templates, and reflection prompts. Labs can be taught over three days (e.g., at the end of each boot camp day) or spread out weekly in modular programs.

**Your role as facilitator:**

* Guide, not direct. Let teams drive the work and navigate ambiguity.  
* Provide clarity when needed, especially on unfamiliar acquisition terms or agile practices.  
* Use reflection questions to deepen insight and align experience to real-world roles.  
* Offer “injects” or scenario updates to simulate the evolving nature of discovery.

## Details for lab facilitation 

**Background scenario for participants** 

You are part of the Office of Civil Rights (OCR), which has received a directive to improve access, transparency, and integrity around the registration of Emotional Support Animals (ESAs) for individuals seeking accommodations in housing, travel, and public services. Currently, no centralized or consistent digital system exists to register ESAs or verify eligibility in real-time for landlords, airlines, or government service providers, resulting in confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and growing concerns about fraud.

As members of the Office of Civil Rights digital procurement team, you’ve been asked to lead a discovery sprint in collaboration with your CIO counterparts to assess whether a centralized, user-centered ESA Registry is feasible, desirable, and implementable through a future digital service acquisition.

This discovery sprint will help your team:

* Understand the most significant barriers to ESA registration today.  
* Identify the core users of the system and uncover what they need.  
* Explore operational, policy, and technical constraints.  
* Define measurable outcomes for success.  
* Draft a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to serve as the starting point for market research and a future solicitation.

Your findings will directly inform the government’s acquisition approach and lay the groundwork for a more equitable, accessible, and trustworthy ESA registration experience.

The quality of your sprint outputs will directly influence the government’s ability to buy the right solution.

### Week 1: Define the problem and prioritize the user

**Objective:**

Teams orient themselves to the sprint, align on shared goals, and begin framing the problem space. They review the provided materials, analyze starter personas, and start identifying key user pain points and opportunity areas.

 **Facilitator provides:**

* Scenario overview (above)  
* Problem statement (below)  
* 8 Pre-defined personas  
* Persona tiering prompt

| Deliverable | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Team Charter & Name | Teams define their purpose, team norms, communication style, and name. This builds psychological safety and shared ownership. |
| Pain Points & Opportunities | Teams review the scenario and personas to surface the most pressing problems and promising areas for improvement. |
| Persona Prioritization (Tier 1, 2, 3\) | Teams rank personas based on their centrality to the ESA Registry’s impact. This helps narrow focus and align discovery efforts. |

### Facilitator prompt: Team charter and name 

Every great sprint team starts with shared clarity and a bit of personality.
- First, you’ll work together to create your Team Charter—this includes how you’ll communicate, make decisions, and support one another throughout the sprint. Think of it as your team’s agreement for collaboration and respect.
- Next, each of you will choose one of the sprint roles to represent during the discovery process:
    - Product Manager (Team Lead)
    - User Researcher
    - Contracting Specialist
    - Tech Lead (CIO Representative)
    - Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) 

Try to select a role that’s different from your day-to-day experience. This is your chance to approach the ESA Registry problem from a different lens—and it will make your discoveries more human-centered and well-rounded.

Finally, name your team\! Tie it to the Emotional Support Animal theme. You can be serious, clever, or heartfelt—whatever reflects your shared vibe. 
- You’ll share your charter, team name, and role assignments with the group at the end of this session.

### Facilitator prompt: Pain points and opportunities

Before we dive into research or interviews, we want to ground our teams in what we *already know* from the personas and scenarios.
- Using the ESA Registry scenario and the starter problem statements, identify the most significant pain points users face in today’s process. Then, shift gears and look for opportunities, where could this registry have the most important positive impact?
- Consider pain from all angles: emotional stress, time burdens, a lack of trust, or unclear guidance. And think about opportunities beyond tech, this might be a chance to build dignity, fairness, or access into the system.

**Starter problem statement:**
(Can be used as a whole or broken down for different teams)

- While multiple federal policies support the right to ESA accommodations, there is no unified digital infrastructure to support implementation. This disconnect leaves agencies and providers struggling to strike a balance between legal compliance, operational feasibility, and user experience.
- The current process for verifying emotional support animals is fragmented, unclear, and lacks a centralized registry. This results in confusion for users, inconsistent verification for landlords and airlines, and an increase in fraud. A more effective process could enhance dignity, alleviate burden, and address legitimate needs.
- People with legitimate emotional support needs, particularly veterans, low-income individuals, and those with mental health conditions, face inconsistent, confusing, and stigmatizing processes when seeking accommodations for their ESAs. The lack of a centralized, accessible ESA registry disproportionately impacts those already marginalized by bureaucracy.

Stakeholder Interview Exercise Instructions

**Discovery sprint – Week 2 activity**

**Goal:** Simulate real-world user research by conducting a stakeholder interview using a GPT-based assistant such as ChatGPT. You will use this insight to understand better the needs, constraints, and pain points relevant to your functional role in the ESA Registry sprint.

**Overview**

In this activity, you will independently conduct a simulated interview with a stakeholder using ChatGPT (or another GPT-based assistant). Your goal is to generate realistic insights that mirror what a government professional might learn in early-stage discovery.

**You will:**
1. Use your role-specific prompt to initiate the simulation.  
2. Create an interview guide with 5–7 thoughtful, open-ended questions.  
3. Conduct a dialogue with GPT to simulate a real-time stakeholder exchange.  
4. Capture notes on key insights, surprises, and unanswered questions.  
   Bring your insights to your role-based group session for consolidation.

**General instructions (provided to participants)**

1. **Start by reviewing the prompt for your role below.** This provides GPT with context and instructs it to behave like a realistic stakeholder.  
2. **Paste the prompt into ChatGPT**, then introduce yourself and explain why you're conducting this interview.  
3. **Develop and ask your interview questions one at a time**, responding naturally and adjusting your approach based on the answers.  
4. **Capture notes** during your conversation. Don’t worry about perfection—treat it like real discovery: messy, exploratory, and human.  
5. **Be curious and empathetic**—ask follow-ups if needed.  
6. **After the interview**, summarize:  
   * 3–5 key insights.  
   * 1–2 surprises or unexpected takeaways.  
   * Any open questions or follow-up areas.

**Role-based GPT prompts and interview focus**

Use the prompt below for your role to start your conversation in GPT. After the simulation begins, please introduce yourself and proceed with your interview questions.

**Product Manager (Team Lead)**

**Prompt to copy into GPT:**

_You are a stakeholder with experience working on federal service delivery programs that intersect with housing or disability access. Please simulate a 1:1 interview with a federal Product Manager conducting early discovery for a digital Emotional Support Animal Registry. Be open and realistic about concerns, limitations, and expectations you’ve encountered in your work._

**Interview focus:**

* What outcomes would matter most from an ESA Registry?  
* Where do past digital services fall short?  
* What policy or political considerations should we anticipate?

**User Researcher**

**Prompt to copy into GPT:**

_You are someone who either uses an Emotional Support Animal (ESA), has attempted to obtain accommodations, or has supported a family member through this process. Please simulate a user research interview with a federal researcher trying to understand the ESA experience from the public’s perspective._

**Interview focus:**

* What was your experience like trying to get ESA approval or documentation?  
* What helped? What got in the way?  
* How did the process make you feel?

**Contracting Specialist**

**Prompt to copy into GPT:**

_You are a federal procurement or legal stakeholder who has supported service acquisitions involving healthcare, housing, or disability services. Please simulate an interview with a Contracting Specialist conducting discovery for a future procurement of a digital ESA Registry._

**Interview focus:**

* What acquisition risks do you anticipate in this space?  
* What past procurements succeeded or failed—and why?  
* What would you want to see in a well-written Statement of Objectives?

**Tech Lead (CIO Representative)**

**Prompt to copy into GPT:**

* **Top 3–5 insights** (What did you learn?).  
* **Surprises** (What was unexpected?).  
* **Open questions** (What gaps remain?).  
* **Quote or theme** that stood out (optional).

You’ll use this to consolidate research and identify shared patterns across roles in preparation for the sprint team synthesis.

## Facilitator instructions for the independent research

**Discovery Sprint – Week 2**  

**Purpose:** To deepen participants' understanding of the policy, legal, operational, and technical environment that will impact the design and procurement of an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) Registry.

### Goal of the drills

Participants will independently explore 1–2 key areas related to ESA accommodations, government systems, or legal/policy frameworks. These targeted research activities simulate real-world prep work done by product teams, CORs, and acquisition professionals during early discovery.

By the end of this exercise, participants should come back with:

* **Relevant policies, rules, or systems** that would impact the registry.  
* **Constraints or enablers** worth raising in team discussions.  
* **Insights** that could shape product direction, scope, or evaluation strategy.

**Instructions for participants**

1. Choose 1–2 topics from the list provided (based on your role or curiosity).  
   Spend 30–45 minutes researching articles, policy memos, government websites, or agency guidance.  
2. Document your findings using the reflection questions below.  
3. Be prepared to bring your takeaways to your next team session.

### Suggested researhc topics (pick 1–2)

| Category | Research Topic |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Policy & Regulation** | ADA and Fair Housing Act ESA definitions HUD guidance on ESA documentation DOT regulations on emotional support animals and travel. |
| **Procurement & Legal** | Legal risks in procuring systems involving medical or behavioral data Past ESA-related fraud or complaints What federal privacy laws (HIPAA, Privacy Act) apply. |
| **Technology & Systems** | Is there an existing registry or verification system in another agency? Could Login.gov or ID verification tools support this system? Interoperability with HUD or VA systems. |
| **User Trust & Access** | Examples of federal services that gained or lost public trust Digital inclusion concerns: broadband, literacy, multilingual access Cost or burden for low-income users. |
| **Evaluation & Oversight** | How success is typically measured in accommodation programs What performance indicators could be used in an ESA system How FOIA, audits, or public records affect transparency. |

### Reflection questions (for individual notes)

Encourage participants to jot down their answers to these prompts as they research:

1. What did you learn that surprised you?  
2. What seems like a major constraint or risk?  
3. What existing systems or policies could we align with or avoid duplicating?  
4. How could this influence our product vision or acquisition strategy?

**Optional:** Share a quote, stat, or headline that made you think differently about the problem.

### **Tips for facilitation**

* Encourage participants to stay curious, this isn’t about being right, it’s about discovering what matters.  
* Recommend they focus on relevance over depth—a key insight or contradiction is more useful than a full legal brief.  
* You may invite participants to drop quick notes in Slack or a shared doc before the next session.

## Facilitator instructions: Journey mapping activity

**Overview**

Journey mapping helps teams center on a real user experience and move from abstract assumptions to concrete insights. In this activity, each team will select one persona and collaboratively create a current-state journey map that captures the emotional and functional experience of that person navigating the ESA registration process.

The result will be a shared visual tool that informs problem framing, user needs, and acquisition requirements.

**Materials needed**

* Printed or digital Journey Map Template (one per team).  
* Persona Cards (from the ESA Registry scenario).  
* Markers or Miro/Mural/Google Slides (if virtual).  
* Sticky notes or digital note boxes for each stage.

**Activity setup**

**1\. Introduce the purpose (3–5 minutes)**

**Explain to participants:**
* A journey map helps teams visualize what a real user experiences—not just tasks, but also thoughts, emotions, and pain points.  
* The goal is not to fix the journey, but to understand it deeply enough to design better questions, solutions, and requirements.

**2\. Choose a persona (5 minutes)**

**Instructions to each sprint team:**
* Select one persona from the eight provided.  
  * Tip: Facilitators ensure each team has a different persona. You can choose to pre-assign.   
* Briefly re-read or reintroduce themselves to the persona’s background, pain points, and needs.

**3\. Journey map template**

Each team will fill out a simple **Current state journey map** with the following columns:

| Stage | Actions | Thoughts | Emotions | Pain Points | Opportunities |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. Awareness |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2\. Research |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3\. Documentation |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4\. Submission |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5\. Follow-up/Outcome |  |  |  |  |  |

**Facilitator tip:** These stages are customizable if the persona’s story differs (e.g., therapist issuing a letter, housing manager processing a request).

**Time breakdown (60 minutes total)**
* **5 minutes:** Select persona & assign team facilitator/note-taker.  
* **30 minutes:** Complete the journey map together (focus on user experience—not internal processes).  
* **15 minutes:** Do a “gallery walk” so each team can provide a readout to the rest of the class that highlights their key takeaways for each persona.  
* **5 minutes:** Prepare a short reflection for the next team share-out or synthesis session.

### **Descriptions for the prompts in each column**

* **Actions:** What is the user doing at this stage? What steps do they take?  
* **Thoughts:** What questions or decisions are they facing?  
* **Emotions:** How do they feel at this point? (frustrated, anxious, empowered, etc.)  
* **Pain points:** Where do they get stuck, confused, or frustrated?  
* **Opportunities:** What could make this experience easier, more transparent, or more supportive?

### **Tips for facilitation**

* Encourage teams to stay in their persona’s shoes, not their expertise.  
* Push for empathy \+ specificity—what exactly is confusing or frustrating in a moment?  
* If teams get stuck: Have them imagine what the persona sees, hears, or Googles in each phase.  
* Use real quotes or insights from their stakeholder interviews to add depth and authenticity.

## **Debrief option (optional 10 – 15 minutes)**

After maps are complete, lead a short team share-out:

* What surprised you about your persona’s journey?  
* What pain points felt preventable?  
* Which parts would be most helpful to solve first?

**This sets the stage for Week 3, when teams begin defining product vision and success metrics.**

## Week 3: Frame the solution and connect to the acquisition

**Objective:**

Teams synthesize their research and insights to define a product vision and measurable outcomes. They will use these to draft a Statement of Objectives (SOO) that could support market research and future solicitation development.

**Facilitator provides:**

* A draft hypothesis statement to anchor team synthesis.
* Guidance or template for creating a Product vision, success metrics, and SOO.
* Examples of clear, high-level SOOs (optional).

**Sprint team activities and deliverables:**

| Deliverable | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Product Vision Statement | A clear, aspirational yet realistic description of what the team believes the digital ESA Registry should achieve. This should reflect user needs, policy goals, and constraints. |
| Success Metrics | Key indicators of what “good” looks like—these should be tied to performance outcomes (not features). Metrics can be quantitative (e.g. reduction in fraud reports) or qualitative (e.g. user trust or satisfaction). |
| Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) | A short, outcomes-oriented document that reflects the discovery findings. It should avoid prescribing specific solutions and instead focus on what the government wants to achieve. This SOO can serve as a starting point for a future solicitation or RFQ. |

### Facilitation prompt: Product vision and success metrics

**Purpose**

Now that your team has explored the problem space and user needs, it’s time to begin shaping a clear direction for what the ESA Registry could become. This session focuses on defining a Product Vision Statement and identifying measurable Success Metrics.

The Product Vision should reflect your team’s shared understanding of what you’re trying to achieve—not a list of features, but a bold, human-centered description of the change your service should create.

Success Metrics then help define how you’ll know you’re on the right path. These should align with outcomes, not outputs.

These artifacts will lay the foundation for your draft Statement of Objectives (SOO).

**What makes a good product vision?**

A strong product vision:

* Is short and inspiring: 1–3 sentences max.  
* Reflects real user needs and mission goals.  
* Avoids jargon and is easily shareable.  
* Focuses on value or transformation, not features.  
* Is broad enough to invite creative solutions but focused enough to guide decisions.

**Facilitator-provided hypothesis (choose or adapt):**

Here are three example hypotheses teams can use as a starting point:

1. “We believe that by creating a secure, centralized digital registry for emotional support animals, we can reduce fraudulent claims, improve user trust and access, and provide real-time verification tools to agencies and service providers—resulting in more equitable and efficient accommodations.”

2. “We believe that simplifying and standardizing the ESA registration process will help users with real needs navigate the system with less stress, while also giving landlords and providers a fair, consistent way to validate claims.”

3. “We believe that enabling real-time, privacy-conscious verification of ESA documentation will help reduce conflict, build trust, and ensure accommodations are handled fairly across housing, travel, and service settings.”

**Facilitator prompt (read aloud)**

You’ve explored the user experience, pain points, and constraints—now let’s define where your product should go.

Start with the hypothesis. Use it as a draft or adapt it based on what you’ve learned. Then work as a team to craft:

1. **A product vision statement**: A short, clear statement about what the product should achieve for its users and the mission.  
2. **Success metrics**: Concrete, meaningful ways you’ll know the service is having its intended impact.

This is the bridge from discovery to delivery. Make it meaningful, specific, and rooted in your research.

**Brainstorm prompts**

**For the product vision:**

* What change are we trying to create?  
* What will be true for our users if this works?  
* What problem are we solving—and who benefits?  
* What will this product make *easier*, *more transparent*, or *fairer*?

**For success metrics:**

* What would we track if we wanted to prove this product is working?  
* How would we know it’s improving trust, access, or fairness?  
* What indicators matter most to users? To the agency?

### **Examples for inspiration**

**Product vision example:**

“A simple, trustworthy digital service that ensures anyone with a legitimate ESA can access the accommodations they’re entitled to without confusion, stigma, or delay.”

**Success metrics example ideas:**

* % of ESA registrations verified in under 48 hours.  
* Reduction in rejected or incomplete applications.  
* User-reported trust or satisfaction scores.  
* % of underserved users completing registration successfully.  
* Fewer fraud reports or complaints from service providers.

### Facilitator instructions: Drafting the SOO

**Purpose**

The goal of this activity is to pull together everything your team has discovered into a Statement of Objectives (SOO)—a high-level acquisition artifact that communicates the *what* and *why*, without prescribing the *how*. A strong SOO helps agency teams define outcomes that industry can respond to creatively and effectively.

This will be the final team deliverable of the sprint and should reflect your user research, product vision, and defined success criteria.

**Facilitator prompt:**

You’ve defined the problem, prioritized user needs, mapped the current experience, and crafted a product vision. Now it’s time to connect your discovery work to a real-world acquisition outcome: the Statement of Objectives.

This is the type of language the government uses to communicate goals to industry without dictating the solution. Your draft SOO should capture:
* The problem we’re trying to solve.  
* The mission outcomes we want to achieve.  
* The performance expectations or success metrics.  
* And any significant constraints or environmental factors.

**SOO structure**

Encourage teams to use this structure (modify as needed):
1. Background / Context
   * Why is this needed? What are the drivers?  
   * Reference the user pain points, policy shifts, or fraud concerns.  
2. Problem statement / Objective  
   * A 1–2 sentence description of what the government aims to solve or improve.
3. Desired outcomes  
   * What should this solution achieve for users, staff, or the public?  
   * Building out the statement of objectives to align with the product vision.
4. Performance considerations  
   * What would success look like? How should it be measured?
5. Constraints / Environment  
   * Any legal, policy, or tech factors that must be considered.

**Brainstorm prompts for teams**

* What are the core mission outcomes we need to achieve?  
* How does this SOO reflect the user needs we uncovered?  
* What are we trying to avoid—what’s not in scope?  
* What’s the one thing we’d want industry to understand?  
* Keep the SOO user-centered and outcome-focused  
* Avoid jumping into solution details (e.g., don’t list features or platforms)  
* Use plain language—users and stakeholders should understand a good SOO, not just procurement staff

**Facilitator prompt: Final discovery presentation and retrospective**

**Purpose**

This session allows each sprint team to present the results of their discovery work and reflect critically on the process. Teams will share their draft Statement of Objectives and engage in a facilitated retrospective to consider how this work can be applied in their real-world roles as Product Managers and CORs.

**Presentation prompt (read aloud)**

You’ve completed a fast-paced, cross-functional discovery sprint. You’ve investigated user needs, uncovered policy and operational constraints, and defined a vision along with measurable outcomes.

Now, each team will present its work and reflect on the experience. This is your chance to articulate what you’ve learned, what you’re recommending, and how this type of approach could fit into real acquisition and delivery environments.

**Each team will present (5–7 minutes):**

Ask each team to share the following:

1. Selected persona: Who did you focus on, and why?  
2. Product vision statement: What is the future you're aiming to create?  
3. Success metrics: How will you know you’re making progress?  
4. Draft Statement of Objectives (SOO): How would you frame this problem for a future solicitation?  
5. Key insight: What’s one thing that changed your perspective during this sprint?

**Tip:** Encourage visuals or written artifacts if helpful (e.g., slides, documents, Miro boards).

## **Facilitated retrospective questions (after all teams present)**

Use these prompts to facilitate a group discussion:

**Feasibility and application**

* How feasible is this type of discovery sprint in your current organization or process?  
* Where might it fit—before market research? Before a performance work statement?  
* What small actions could you take to increase this kind of work on your next procurement?

**On the SOO itself**

* Do you believe your SOO is actionable?  
* If a vendor received this SOO, what kind of response might it generate?  
* Would it need anything else to be ready for market research?

**Reflection on the process**

* What surprised you about this process?  
* Where did your team feel the most challenged? Why?  
* Where did you feel the most empathy for the user or stakeholders?  
* How did working in cross-functional roles shift your thinking?

**Optional Wrap-Up Question**

Ask each participant or team to share one of the following:

* One idea you’re taking back to your workplace.  
* One thing you’d change in how discovery is approached.  
* One thing you appreciated about how your team worked together.
