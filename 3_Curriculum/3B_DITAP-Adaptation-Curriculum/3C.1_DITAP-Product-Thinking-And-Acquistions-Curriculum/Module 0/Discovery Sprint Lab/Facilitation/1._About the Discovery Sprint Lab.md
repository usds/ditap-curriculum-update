# Discovery Sprint Lab (Practice Sprint)

For Product Managers & CORs.

## About the discovery sprint lab 

**Introduction and purpose**

**A. Why are we doing this?**

* Digital services fail when we assume too much and learn too late.
* Discovery Sprints help teams:
  * Focus on real user needs, not assumptions.
  * Understand operational, policy, and technical constraints.
  * Avoid waste by aligning the solution to actual mission outcomes.
* This lab simulates a “lightweight discovery sprint” in a government context and can be used to gather and define requirements and scope for an upcoming acquisition.

**B. Course connection**

This lab reinforces key concepts from earlier modules:

* **Module 1: Agile mindset and roles**  
  → Practice user-centered, iterative thinking in a cross-functional team.
* **Module 2: Discovery and problem framing**  
  → Apply techniques like stakeholder interviews, journey mapping, and defining success criteria.
* **Module 3: Framing requirements**  
  → Convert discovery findings into usable inputs for a SOO/PWS or evaluation strategy.
* **Module 4: Managing delivery**  
  → Understand how good discovery work sets the foundation for performance.

## Learning objectives

* **Apply a product mindset** to early-stage problem framing.  
  * Focus on the *problem*, not the solution.  
* **Conduct self-directed research** to uncover user needs, policy drivers, and technical constraints.  
  * Use discovery techniques such as stakeholder interviews, reviewing existing documentation, and analyzing current systems or processes.→ Learn to ask meaningful questions, identify important patterns, and make informed decisions even when information is incomplete.  
* **Identify and prioritize user needs, mission drivers, and environmental constraints**  
  * Translate raw observations into structured insights that guide design and acquisition.  
*  **Capture findings in acquisition-aligned formats**  
  * Document key insights as usable inputs for a Statement of Objectives (SOO), Performance Work Statement (PWS), or evaluation criteria.  
*   **Collaborate in a cross-functional team**  
    - Experience the dynamics of working with researchers, technologists, SMEs, and acquisition professionals.

## Alignment to acquisition lifecycle

The outputs from this lab can directly support:
* **Market research and requirements development**  
  (Discovery outputs feed a meaningful SOO or PWS).
* **Acquisition strategy**  
  (Clear understanding of what outcomes matter and what constraints exist).
* **Proposal evaluation planning**  
  (User needs and success criteria help define what “good” looks like).
