# Product Thinking and Digital Service Delivery
Digital services and the product mindset are fundamentally intertwined in modern government.

## How Digital Services and the Product Mindset Work Together
In traditional government IT, technology is often treated as a one-time deliverable, something that’s built, handed off, and left unchanged. _**But digital services are never truly “done**”._ They must evolve with user behavior, policy shifts, accessibility standards, and mission needs.

A **product mindset** equips digital service teams to:
- **Focus on users, not just requirements**.
    - Success is defined by how well the service works in real-life situations—not just whether it meets a spec.
- **Continuously improve**.
    - Teams can test, learn, and release updates frequently based on real-time data and feedback.
- **Stay aligned with mission outcomes**.
    - Services remain relevant and effective even as agency priorities or external conditions change.
- **Prioritize what matters most**.
    - Roadmaps shift based on user impact, urgency, and evolving needs—not arbitrary deadlines.

## Examples in Action
Rather than delivering a one-time website to apply for disaster relief, a team using a product mindset builds a **scalable platform** that adapts over time:
- New content is added when policies or eligibility rules change.
- Interfaces improve based on usability testing and analytics.
- Accessibility is enhanced through audits and feedback.
- Language support and mobile features expand to reach more users.

By treating digital services as evolving products, not static projects—government teams can build trust, improve equity, and deliver truly responsive public services.
