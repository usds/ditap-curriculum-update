# Understanding Digital Services  

## What Are Digital Services?
Digital services are modern, technology-enabled tools that help people interact with the government in more efficient, accessible, and user-friendly ways. These services include websites, mobile applications, APIs, and automated systems that provide information, enable transactions, or offer support across a wide range of programs.

**A well-designed digital service**:
- Solves real user problems.
- Is accessible to all, including people with disabilities and those with limited English proficiency.
- Evolves over time in response to user feedback, policy changes, and new technologies.
- Meets federal requirements for security, privacy, and performance.

**Examples include**:
- Applying for veterans’ benefits through a streamlined web portal.
- Scheduling a passport appointment online.
- Submitting small business certifications via a digital form.
- Receiving automated text or email updates on application status.

These services aren’t just digital interfaces; they are critical touchpoints that shape how people experience and trust their government.

## Why Digital Services Matter to You
Digital services are not just the responsibility of IT teams, they directly affect your program’s ability to deliver outcomes to the public. As a Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or Program Manager, you help shape how digital services are scoped, acquired, and overseen.

**In today’s landscape**:
- Citizens expect digital services that work quickly and intuitively.
- Mission outcomes increasingly depend on user-facing digital tools.
- Oversight bodies and leadership are tracking real-world service metrics, not just IT deliverables.

Take the Department of Veterans Affairs: when it modernized its disability claims process using digital service principles, it cut processing time from 125 days to under 30. That wasn’t just technology, it was smarter, more adaptive service delivery shaped by the people overseeing the contracts and systems.
