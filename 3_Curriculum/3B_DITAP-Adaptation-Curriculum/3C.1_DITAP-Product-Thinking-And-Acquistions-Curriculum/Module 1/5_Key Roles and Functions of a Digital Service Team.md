# Key Roles and Functions of a Digital Service Team
Delivering great digital services takes more than just technology. It takes a collaborative, multidisciplinary team. Government and contractor roles each bring essential expertise, authority, and perspective to the table.
- Government team members ensure alignment with mission goals, policies, and public accountability. They bring deep program knowledge and the authority to make decisions.
- Contractor team members provide critical delivery capacity, technical skills, and design expertise to build and improve the service.

Each role, from the Product Owner and COR to UX designers, engineers, and translators, plays a distinct part in making digital services usable, inclusive, secure, and sustainable. When these roles work together, government can deliver services that truly meet people’s needs and evolve over time.

## Key Government Team Roles
- **Product Owner** (Government)
    - Senior-level decision maker with autonomy to act without escalation.
    - Maximizes value delivered by the team.
    - Aligns the backlog with mission goals and user needs.

- **Contracting Officer's Representative** (COR)
    - Provides daily oversight and technical guidance.
    - Monitors performance and deliverables in alignment with agile goals.

    - Practices test-driven development and pairs with other developers for code quality.
- **DevOps Engineer**
    - Automates infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment processes.
    - Enables faster, safer delivery through containerization, observability, and infrastructure as code.
- **Technical Architect**
    - Defines technical direction, patterns, and standards across the system.
    - Ensures the system design supports scalability, maintainability, and government compliance.
- **Security Engineer / Security Architect**
    - Embeds security into the development lifecycle (“DevSecOps”).

## Summary: Why Digital Services and Product Mindset Matter
In this module, we explored what digital services are, how they function in government, and why adopting a product mindset is essential for delivering lasting public value.
We learned that digital services are not one-time websites or tools, they are dynamic, user-centered solutions that help people access critical government services. When done right, digital services are accessible, inclusive, adaptable, and designed to solve real problems for real people.

But great digital services don’t happen by accident, they require a product mindset:
- A commitment to continuous improvement.
- A focus on user outcomes over static requirements.
- The flexibility to evolve with policy changes, user feedback, and technology.

We examined the difference between project and product thinking and saw how cross-functional teams, including Product Owners, CORs, UX Researchers, Developers, and more, collaborate to keep services evolving over time.
Through today’s exercise, we saw how applying a product mindset to real government service challenges helps shift focus from “Did we deliver on time?” to “Are we actually meeting people’s needs?”

**Key Takeaways**:
- Digital services are living products, not static deliverables.
- A product mindset supports long-term service quality, trust, and relevance.
- Empowered, collaborative teams are essential to sustaining this mindset in practice.
- Success is measured not by checkboxes—but by the impact we have on users.


As you move forward in this course, continue to think like a product team. Ask not just “_Did we build it right_?” but also “_Is it still the right thing to build_?”
