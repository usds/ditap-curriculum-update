# Class Activity: Fix It Like a Product Team 
Now that you understand how digital services work and why a product mindset matters, it’s time to apply that thinking to a real-world example. In this activity, you’ll reflect on a government service you’ve used that felt confusing or outdated and explore how a product-minded team might improve it. You’ll connect service challenges to missed user needs and consider how continuous delivery and user-centered design can lead to better outcomes.

## Step 1: Individual Reflection (3 minutes)
Participants take a few minutes to jot down their thoughts:
- What was the service?
- What went wrong or could be improved?
- What did it seem like the team was optimizing for—delivering on time, or delivering continuous value to users?

## Step 2: Small Group Discussion (8 minutes)
In groups of 3–4, participants:
- Share their individual examples.
- Select one scenario to explore in more detail.
- As a group, discuss and capture:
    - What user needs were likely missed?
    - How could a product mindset improve the experience?
    - What is one change the team could make if they were focused on ongoing service delivery?

## Step 3: Lightning Share-Out (3 minutes)
Invite 2–3 groups to briefly share their selected scenario and one product mindset shift they would recommend.</br>

**Optional Wrap-Up Prompt (30 seconds)**
_Digital services are more than one-time deliverables, they’re public experiences that should evolve with people’s needs. Product thinking helps us design with users, not just for them_.
