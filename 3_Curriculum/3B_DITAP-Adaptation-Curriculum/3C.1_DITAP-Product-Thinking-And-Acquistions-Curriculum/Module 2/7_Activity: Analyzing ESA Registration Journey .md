# Class Activity: Analyzing ESA Registration Journey (Part One)  
This two-part activity gives you the chance to apply what you’ve learned about discovery tools. To begin, you’ll analyze a fictional user journey to identify pain points and uncover opportunities for improvement. In Part Two, you’ll define success criteria that reflect real user outcomes based on that opportunity.

Together, these exercises will help you practice translating user insights into actionable guidance, just like a discovery team would do before shaping a procurement strategy.

## Activity Instructions:

**Scenario Refresher:**  
Citizens across the country want to register their emotional support animals (ESAs) and receive official recognition for their calming companions. However, the current ESA landscape is cluttered with unofficial websites, conflicting policies, and skeptical service industry personnel and landlords. The National Office of Things & Stuff (NOTS) has been tasked with conducting a 20-minute discovery sprint to explore what a centralized, trustworthy, and humane ESA registry might look like.

**Instructions:**

1. Review Chloe’s journey map.  
2. Identify the top three pain points. 
3. Propose one opportunity for improvement.
4. Frame a “how might we” question based on that opportunity.

### Journey map analysis
**Fictional Journey Map:** Chloe, College Student with Anxiety and a Ferret ("Professor Nibbles")</br>

| Stage | Action | Thoughts | Feelings |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. Searches online for the ESA registry | Googles "register emotional support animal" | So many sketchy-looking sites... which one is real? | Confused, overwhelmed |
| 2\. Clicks the top search result | Lands on a flashy third-party site charging $199 | Wait, is this even legal? | Skeptical, unsure |
| 3\. Tries to find official .gov site | Checks .gov results but finds inconsistent info | There’s no central place? What a mess. | Frustrated, distrustful |
| 4\. Asks campus therapist for help | The therapist says there’s no federal registry | Why do so many sites say there is one? | Irritated, discouraged |
| 5\. Gives up and downloads a free ESA letter template | Prints it and uses it with the landlord and the airline | Hope no one checks too hard… | Nervous, unsupported |

**Critical Thinking Prompts:**
- Where in the journey does trust break down?  
- What’s the most emotionally frustrating moment?  
- Where is the user most likely to be confused or misinformed?  
- Which pain point has the greatest impact and is the most fixable?  
- Did your group agree on the same pain points?
- What kind of user data would help you validate your assumptions?
