# Class Activity: Defining the Success Criteria (Part Two)
Now that you’ve identified a key opportunity to improve the user experience, it’s time to define what success would look like. In this activity, you’ll work with your team to develop clear, measurable success criteria that reflect user needs and outcomes—not just system delivery. This step helps connect discovery insights to performance measures that can guide procurement planning and delivery oversight.

## Activity instructions:

1. Revisit the opportunity you identified in the journey map activity.
2. As a team, define **2–3 success criteria** for that opportunity. Your criteria should reflect:
   - What success looks like for the *user* (not the agency).
   - Outcomes that can be observed, measured, or validated.
3. Share your top success metric during the debrief.

**Examples of User-Centered Success Criteria:**
- 80% of users say they trust the ESA registration site is legitimate.
- Landlords report fewer disputes related to ESA documentation.
- Users complete the ESA process in under 10 minutes without dropping off.
- No complaints from airlines about forged ESA documents within 6 months.

**Group Discussion: Reflect on Your Success Criteria**

After defining your success criteria, take a few minutes to discuss the following questions with your group. Be prepared to share one key insight with the class.
- How did your team decide your criteria were measurable? What made them realistic to track or evaluate?  
- Which user-centered values did you prioritize—ease, trust, accessibility, or something else? Why?  
- What kind of feedback or data would help you refine or validate your success metrics?
