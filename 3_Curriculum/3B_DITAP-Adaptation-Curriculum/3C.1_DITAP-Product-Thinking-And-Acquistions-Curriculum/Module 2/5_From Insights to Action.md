# From Insights to Action
After conducting user research, mapping journeys, and identifying stakeholder needs, the final step in a discovery sprint is to turn those insights into clear, actionable direction. In this section, participants will learn how to synthesize their knowledge into informed decisions that shape acquisition strategy, delivery planning, and stakeholder engagement.

This part of the module focuses on identifying key pain points and opportunity areas, defining what success should look like, and preparing to share findings in a way that builds buy-in and informs next steps. For CORs and program staff, this is where discovery starts to connect directly to the procurement lifecycle. It helps you craft more focused PWS or SOOs, define evaluation criteria, and support iterative, outcome-oriented delivery.

The goal of this section is to help learners move confidently from problem understanding to solution planning, ensuring that discovery does not end in a report but leads to informed, mission-aligned action.

## Identify Pain Points and Opportunity Areas
This step involves analyzing the insights gained from user research, journey mapping, and stakeholder interviews to identify *areas for improvement* and *areas that are not working*. Identifying pain points and opportunity areas bridges the gap between understanding problems and taking action, informing design, policy, procurement, and prioritization.

### What are pain points?
Pain points are the *specific moments of friction, confusion, delay, or dissatisfaction* that users or internal staff experience when interacting with a service or system. Pain points show where the system breaks down; opportunity areas show where it can evolve. When identified clearly, they connect discovery insights directly to decision-making, procurement language, and design priorities.

They might be:
- **Emotional:** “I felt anxious because I didn’t get confirmation.”  
- **Technical:** “The upload system times out.”  
- **Procedural:** “I have to re-enter the same information in three systems.”  
- **Policy-related:** “I was denied eligibility for a minor paperwork error.”  
- **Access-related:** “The site doesn’t work on mobile or with screen readers.”

**Example from journey map**:  
During “Submit Documentation,” users feel frustrated because the portal times out, and there’s no guidance on acceptable file types or size limits.

### What are opportunity areas?

Opportunity areas are *potential ways to enhance the service, remove barriers, or create a better experience* for users and staff. These are not yet solutions, but they point the team in the direction of future action.

They often stem directly from pain points. For example:
- **Pain Point:** Users abandon forms due to confusing language.  
  **Opportunity:** Rewrite application steps using plain language and a step-by-step guide.

- **Pain Point:** Staff re-enter data from printed forms.  
  **Opportunity:** Introduce a digital intake form with backend system integration.

- **Pain Point:** Non-English speakers rely on others to complete forms.  
  **Opportunity:** Add multilingual support and culturally competent help content.

### How to identify pain points

1. Review user research and journey maps.
    - Highlight “hot spots” where confusion, drop-off, or frustration occurs.  
    - Identify repeated themes in interviews or surveys.  
       
2. Cluster similar issues.
    - Use sticky notes, Mural/Miro, or whiteboards to group pain points by type (tech, policy, process, content, etc.).  

3. Ask key questions:
   - What’s causing this pain? (Root cause)  
   - Who does it affect?  
   - What’s the impact on users, staff, or mission outcomes?  
   - Is this a quick fix or a structural issue?  
       
4. Generate opportunity statements.</br>
 **Use the format:**
   - “How might we…”  
   - “What would it take to…”  
   - “If we could solve X, what might improve Y?”

**Example:**

| Pain Point | Who It Affects | Impact | Opportunity Area |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Users don’t receive application status updates | Applicants | Anxiety, unnecessary phone calls | Add real-time status tracker \+ confirmation emails |
| Staff manually re-key information | Intake workers | Time-consuming, error-prone | Build backend data integration or intake API |
| Website content is written in legal jargon | Public users | Abandonment, misunderstanding of eligibility | Rewrite with plain language and visual aids |

### Why it matters
- Helps prioritize efforts: Not all problems are equal; focus on high-impact ones.  
- Informs the scope in the PWS/SOO: Instead of vague goals like "improve the system," you can specify clear problem areas and desired outcomes.  
- Promotes collaborative alignment: Gives stakeholders a shared view of where improvement is most needed.  
- Encourages iterative thinking: Opportunity areas feed directly into solution brainstorming, prototyping, or Agile delivery.

## Define Success Criteria and Next Steps 
The act of defining success criteria turns discovery insights into *actionable goals* and *clear guidance* for what should happen after the sprint. It is about asking:
- What does “better” look like?  
- How will we know if future work is successful?  
- What’s the smartest next step based on what we’ve learned?

By defining success criteria, you ensure that future implementation, procurement, or design decisions are *outcome-driven* rather than output-focused. And by laying out clear next steps, you help the agency maintain momentum beyond the sprint.

### Define success criteria
Success criteria are measurable indicators that show whether user needs are being met and goals are being achieved. These are *not* just project checkboxes (“we launched a portal”); they are tied to *user outcomes and agency impact*.

**Good success criteria are:**
- **Specific:** Clear and understandable  
- **User-centered:** Tied to user behavior, satisfaction, or outcomes  
- **Measurable:** Quantitative or qualitative  
- **Time-bound:** Achievable in a realistic timeframe

| Area | Weak Metric | Strong Success Criterion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Access | “New website launched” | “80% of users can complete the application in under 10 minutes on mobile” |
| Adoption | “Forms redesigned” | “50% reduction in paper submissions within 6 months” |
| Usability | “User testing conducted” | “User satisfaction scores increase from 3.2 to 4.5 on task clarity” |
| Efficiency | “Backend integrated” | “Intake staff report 30% fewer re-keying errors” |

### How to determine success criteria
1. Revisit your problem statement. 
    - Ask: “How would we observe or measure the improvement if this problem were solved?”
2. Use what you learned in user research.  
   - Ask: “What would improve the experience for this user group?” or “What are signs that pain points are being addressed?”
3. Consider multiple perspectives:
   - External users (e.g., faster access to benefits, less confusion)  
   - Internal staff (e.g., fewer workarounds, reduced processing time)  
   - Agency mission (e.g., increased equity, reduced cost)  
4. Make it measurable.  
   - Where possible, tie your criteria to actual metrics, application completion rates, dropped calls, processing time, Net Promoter Score (NPS), etc.

## Activity: Analyze the ESA Registration Journey (Part One) 
You’ve just learned how to collect user insights, build personas, and map current-state experiences. Now it’s time to put those skills into practice. In this activity, you’ll analyze a fictional user journey and identify where things break down. Your goal is to surface key pain points and uncover at least one opportunity to improve the experience. This is the first part of a two-part activity. In Part Two, you’ll build on what you find here to define success criteria that reflect real user outcomes. 

## Activity: Define Success Criteria (Part Two) 
In the first part of this activity, you identified a user pain point and proposed an opportunity to improve the ESA registration experience. Now it's time to define what success would look like. In this step, your team will develop 2–3 success criteria that reflect real outcomes for users—not just system delivery. Think about how users might define success: Were they able to complete the process easily? Did they trust the experience? Did it reduce confusion or unnecessary steps? By the end of this activity, you’ll have a clearer sense of how to measure value from the user’s perspective—a skill you can apply to both acquisition planning and performance oversight.

### Example of success criteria 
“Residents must be able to complete the government benefit application on a smartphone in under 10 minutes, with a 90% success rate. Call center inquiries about application status should decrease by 40% within 3 months of launch.”

## Define Next Steps
Once you’ve clarified what success looks like, decide how to move toward it. This keeps momentum going and prevents your discovery sprint from being “just an exercise.”

**Possible next steps include:**
- Begin the **acquisition planning** process  
- Starting **solution prototyping** or usability testing  
- Creating a **product roadmap** or delivery backlog  
- Planning a pilot or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) launch  
- Coordinating with **policy/legal teams** to resolve constraints  
- **Presenting findings** to leadership to secure buy-in and funding

  ### Example next steps
  - Finalize personas and journey map artifacts
  - Share sprint findings with the procurement team
  - Begin acquisition planning

<center>Pro tip: Use a Now / Next / Later framework to categorize follow-up work.</center>

## Share Findings with Stakeholders 
Sharing the findings report ensures that the insights, pain points, and opportunities uncovered during the discovery sprint are not just captured; they are understood, accepted, and acted upon by the people who matter most. This step transforms your sprint from a research exercise into a *foundation for change* by aligning decision-makers, implementers, and partners around a shared vision.

It’s also a chance to validate your understanding, build credibility, and spark collaboration for what comes next, whether it is a procurement, a prototype, or a policy shift.

Stakeholders include **anyone with influence, accountability, or a stake in the outcomes** of the problem or potential solution. Think beyond leadership:
- Program managers  
- Policy advisors  
- Product owners  
- Acquisition and contracts teams  
- Frontline workers and call center reps  
- IT/security teams  
- Legal and compliance staff  
- Budget and finance offices  
- Partner agencies or vendors  
- Advocacy groups or community reps

Don't just inform stakeholders, engage them! Their feedback may refine your understanding or help remove blockers.

### What to Share
Focus on the most relevant, high-impact insights. A good stakeholder readout typically includes:

1. The Problem You Explored
   - Brief recap of the problem statement and why it matters.  
   - What you set out to learn or validate.    
2. What You Heard
   - Direct quotes or themes from user interviews and research.  
   - Key personas and what they experience today.  
   - Emotional insights (e.g., anxiety, confusion, frustration).    
3. Current-State Journey Map (Highlights)
   - Friction points and moments of breakdown.  
   - Insights from backend or operational perspectives.      
4. Pain Points and Opportunity Areas
   - Most critical problems to solve.  
   - Early ideas or “how might we” questions.      
5. Success Criteria and Suggested Next Steps
   - What good looks like.  
   - What the agency could do next, and why it matters now.

## Best Practices
- **Tell a story.** Start with the user. Anchor the findings in a human experience, not just charts or quotes.  
- **Highlight what's new or surprising.** Stakeholders tune in when insights challenge assumptions or unlock actionable insights.   
- **Tailor to your audience.** Finance wants ROI and efficiency. Program staff want relief. Policy teams want compliance.  
- **Leave room for discussion.** Use your findings as a conversation starter—not a final report.  
- **Connect to next steps.** Be clear about what you recommend and what support or decision is needed.

**Final note:** 

_Discovery findings are only as valuable as what happens with them_.  
Sharing results is your opportunity to build alignment, momentum, and buy-in, turning research into action and insights into outcomes.
