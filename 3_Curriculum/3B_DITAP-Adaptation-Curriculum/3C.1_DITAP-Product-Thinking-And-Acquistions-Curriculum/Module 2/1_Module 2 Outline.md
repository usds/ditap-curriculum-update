# Module 2 Outline: Understanding People and Problems
This module introduces participants to the Discovery Sprint, a structured, time-bound approach to understanding users, identifying root problems, and informing smarter, more effective acquisitions. By focusing on early-stage research and analysis, Discovery Sprints help teams avoid premature solutions and align their work with real user needs and mission outcomes.

## Module Objectives: 
- Describe the purpose and structure of a Discovery Sprint and how it supports smarter acquisitions.
- Analyze user research to identify root problems and craft strong problem statements.
- Apply product tools like stakeholder maps, personas, and journey maps to uncover user needs.
- Define success criteria and next steps that link user outcomes to mission goals.
