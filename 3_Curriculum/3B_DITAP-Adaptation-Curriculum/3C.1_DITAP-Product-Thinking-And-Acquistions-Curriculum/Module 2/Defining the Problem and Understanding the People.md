# Defining the Problem and Understanding the People 
Now that you understand what a discovery sprint is and why it matters, this next section focuses on how to execute one, starting with the two most essential ingredients:</br>
1. **the problem you're trying to solve**
2. **the people it impacts**.

Discovery work begins long before a vendor is selected or a contract is awarded. It begins by clearly defining the challenge, grounding it in user experience, and identifying the stakeholders involved in the process or affected by its outcomes. In this submodule, you’ll learn how to frame a problem in a way that’s actionable and user-centered, and how to identify the right people, internal and external, who need to be part of your research and design process. These early steps are crucial in shaping an acquisition that yields meaningful, mission-aligned results.

## Define the Problem Statement
The problem statement is the _north star_ of your discovery sprint. It frames what is being investigated and ensures the team is aligned on the purpose of the work. A well-defined problem statement prevents wasted effort, scope creep, and assumptions from driving the project. 

Begin by developing a hypothesis based on current knowledge and understanding of the key challenges in the existing process, system, or tools. Then, use user research conducted during the discovery sprint to test and validate (or refine) that hypothesis based on what you learn.

### What makes a good problem statement?
- **User-Centered**: Focus on the people who experience the issue, not just internal processes or systems.
    - Bad: “Improve the intake form's backend validation.”
    - Good: “Help applicants avoid errors that cause delays in benefit approval.”
- **Mission-Aligned**: Link the problem to the agency’s larger goals (example: access, equity, transparency).
    - Example: “Reduce application abandonment rates for food assistance by understanding why users drop off mid-process.”
- **Open-Ended but Actionable**: A question or statement that invites exploration—not just a yes/no answer.
    - Use statements such as:
        - “How might we…”
        - “To what extent can we…”
         - “What prevents users from…”

### How to develop a problem statement
- Start with an assumption, frustration, or question from the team or stakeholders.
    - Example: “People are calling a lot to check their application status.”
- Ask: What user experience or outcome is at stake?
    - Example: “Applicants are anxious and confused after submitting.”
- Refine it to focus on user needs and mission impact.
    - Problem Statement:
        - “How might we help applicants feel confident and informed after submitting their benefits application?”
          
### Examples of strong problem statements
- “How might we make it easier for non-native English speakers to navigate the healthcare services website on mobile devices?”
- “What are the biggest pain points residents face when trying to update their contact information with multiple agencies?”
- “How can program staff more easily understand which vendors are authorized for emergency procurements?”

## Identify Stakeholders and User Groups
Before you can understand problems or design solutions, you need to know who the service impacts. This step ensures your discovery sprint is inclusive, grounded in reality, and ultimately useful. Identifying key stakeholders and user groups helps focus your research efforts and ensures the future scope reflects the actual needs of all people involved.

### What to Look For
Start by identifying both internal and external potential users.

**External Users** (End Users / Public-Facing)

These are people who use or experience the service directly:
- U.S. residents, citizens, immigrants, or applicants.
- Caregivers, veterans, small business owners.
- People with accessibility needs or language barriers.
- First-time vs. repeat users.

Ask:
- Who interacts with the system, form, or process?
- Whose needs are currently unmet or overlooked?
- Who may have difficulty accessing this service?

**Internal Stakeholders** (Operational / Decision-Makers)

These are people who run, maintain, or are impacted by the service internally:
- Program managers and business unit leaders.
- Customer service agents or case workers.
- Acquisition and contracts staff.
- IT/Security teams.
- Policy, legal, or compliance officials.
- Finance and budget officers.

Ask:
- Who touches the process internally?
- Who maintains or supports the system behind the scenes?
- Who makes or influences decisions?

### Why it matters
If you do not identify the full range of stakeholders:
Your research may miss key perspectives.
Your solution may work for some users but break things for others.
Your future procurement may be scoped too narrowly or too broadly.

A holistic understanding of stakeholders ensures that future solutions are **equitable**, **implementable**, and **adoptable**.

**Tips for Doing It Well**
- Use a Stakeholder Mapping Tool:
    - Map users by their influence versus interest, or by their role in the lifecycle (creator, consumer, maintainer, approver).
- Start with those closest to the service:
    - Frontline staff and current users.
- Prioritize diverse perspectives:
    - Include those who have historically been excluded or underserved (examples: physically, visually, or auditory impaired, and language or technology barriers).
- Do not confuse roles with users:
    - A single role (like “benefits processor”) might represent multiple user types with different needs.
