# Class Activity: Analyzing User Types and Their Challenges
**Discovery Sprint for: Pet.gov, The Federal Emotional Support Animal Registry**

**Scenario setup**: Citizens across the country want to register their emotional support animals (ESAs) and receive official recognition for their calming companions. However, the current ESA landscape is cluttered with unofficial websites, conflicting policies, and skeptical service industry personnel and landlords. The National Office of Things & Stuff (NOTS) has been tasked with conducting a discovery sprint to explore what a centralized, trustworthy, and humane ESA registry might look like.

## Activity Instructions:
For this activity, assume that stakeholders and end-users have already been identified and user research is underway.

1. Identify three potential users/personas.
2. For each persona, list three pain points reflecting challenges they are having with the current ESA landscape.
3. Identify three biggest challenges, the impacts to users or the agency, and the consequences of not taking action.
4. Share one insight per group.

The problem statement:</br> 
_How might we create an ESA registry that earns the trust of users and service industry personnel alike_?

**Identify 2–3 user personas to represent potential users of an ESA system application**</br> 
Examples:
- Anxious college student with a ferret.
- Landlord with twelve ESA requests this week. 
- Government, ESA application reviewer.

**List three pain points for each persona**</br>
Examples:
- “There’s no clear way to prove my hedgehog calms me down.”
- “I found 5 sketchy ESA certificate websites and don’t know which one’s real.”
- “People are abusing the system and bringing alpacas into Trader Joe’s.”

**Identify problems to solve**
- The three most significant problems we see.
- The impact the problems have on the users or agency.
- Consequences of not taking action.
