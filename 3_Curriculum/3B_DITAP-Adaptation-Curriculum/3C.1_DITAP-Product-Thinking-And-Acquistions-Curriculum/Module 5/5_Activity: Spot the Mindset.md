# Class Activity: Spot the Mindset 

**Activity Setup:** This activity helps you practice recognizing the difference between a **project mindset** and a **product mindset** in day-to-day language. These subtle shifts in how we talk can shape team behavior, influence decisions, and signal what we value.

## Activity Instructions: 

In pairs, small groups, or as a full group:

1. Read each quote in the table below.  
2. Decide whether the quote reflects a **project mindset** or a **product mindset**.  
3. If it reflects a **project mindset**, rewrite it to better reflect **product thinking**‚Äîfocusing on users, outcomes, and continuous learning.  
4. Be ready to share and discuss your reasoning.

| Quote | Mindset (Project/Product) | Rewrite with Product Thinking |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| "We‚Äôve delivered all milestones on time, so we‚Äôre good." |  |  |
| "We included this feature because leadership asked for it." |  |  |
| "We talked to 5 users, and the feedback is shaping our next iteration." |  |  |
| "We need to get this over the finish line, regardless of feedback." |  |  |
| "Let‚Äôs review what outcomes this sprint delivered for users." |  |  |

üîç **Tip:** As you work through the examples, pay attention to what‚Äôs being emphasized. Are the quotes focused on deadlines, outputs, or user outcomes? Thinking like a product leader means looking beyond whether work is ‚Äúdone‚Äù and asking whether it‚Äôs delivering value.

## Activity Answer Key:

| Quote | Mindset | Rewritten with Product Thinking |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

| We included this feature because leadership asked for it. | Project | We evaluated this feature based on user needs and evidence. |
| We talked to 5 users, and the feedback is shaping our next iteration. | Product | *Already reflects a product mindset* |
| We need to get this over the finish line, regardless of feedback. | Project | Let‚Äôs revisit the feedback and assess what adjustments are needed before launch. |
| Let‚Äôs review what outcomes this sprint delivered for users. | Product | *Already reflects a product mindset* |
