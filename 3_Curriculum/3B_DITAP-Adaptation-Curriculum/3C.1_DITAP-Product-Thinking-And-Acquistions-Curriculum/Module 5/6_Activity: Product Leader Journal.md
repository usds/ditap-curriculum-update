# Optional Reflection Activity: Product Leader Journal 

Use this journal to build awareness of your growth as a product-minded leader. Set aside 5–10 minutes at the end of each day or week to reflect. You can do this individually or as part of a regular check-in with your team.

## Activity Instructions: 

Respond to the prompts below in your own words. Be honest and specific. Over time, your reflections will reveal patterns, areas for growth, and progress in your product leadership journey.

### Reflection prompts:

* **What did I learn?**

  *(Think: about users, your team, a challenge you faced, or how a decision played out.)*

* **What assumptions did I challenge (or should have challenged)?**

  *(Did you ask “why”? Did you revisit the problem? Were you open to changing course?)*

* **Where did I model product thinking—or miss the chance to?**

  *(Examples: focusing on outcomes, encouraging iteration, staying user-centered.)*
