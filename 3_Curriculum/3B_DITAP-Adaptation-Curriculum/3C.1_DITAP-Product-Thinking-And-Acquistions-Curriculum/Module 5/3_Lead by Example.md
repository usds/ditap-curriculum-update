# Lead by Example 

**Product leadership isn’t about titles.** It’s about how you show up, in meetings, in feedback, and in the decisions you make every day. When you lead with a product mindset, you influence how others think, act, and collaborate. This section explores common leadership moments where PMs, CORs, and POs can model product-aligned behaviors that keep teams focused on users, outcomes, and continuous learning.

## Key Moments for Modeling Product Leadership

### Sprint reviews

Use this opportunity to reinforce user-centered goals and spark alignment around outcomes.

* Ask questions like: “How did this iteration move us closer to solving the user problem?” 
* Offer feedback that reflects both mission needs and agile flexibility.  
* Show appreciation for team effort while nudging toward continuous improvement.

**Why it matters:** Sprint reviews aren’t just demos, they’re a space to validate direction and focus on delivering value to users.

### Vendor check-ins 
Approach vendor relationships with curiosity and partnership—not just oversight.

* Set clear expectations around agile behaviors and open communication.  
* Reinforce shared goals and user outcomes.  
* When needed, redirect vendors who fall back on waterfall habits.

**Why it matters:** Vendors often take their cues from government leaders. Check-ins are a prime opportunity to demonstrate a product mindset in action.

### Drafting evaluation criteria or scope

Use your influence to shape solicitations that invite innovation.

* Push for outcome-based language that reflects real user needs.  
* Ensure evaluation criteria assess a vendor’s ability to deliver iteratively, not just write a good proposal.  
* Collaborate with the CO to align solicitation documents with agile values.

**Why it matters:** What you ask for is what you get. Scope and evaluation language can either enable or block the agility you want to see.

### Escalating blockers

Step in early when something’s off-track, but do it with care.

* Raise issues early and clearly, but constructively.  
* Focus on unblocking the team, not assigning blame.  
* Escalate only when necessary, and offer proposed solutions when possible.  
* Use data or examples from user impact to make the case for action.

**Why it matters:** Momentum matters. Agile leaders protect team flow by helping unblock problems quickly and constructively.

### Responding to risk
Don’t just monitor risk, reframe it.

* Identify risks early and frame them in terms of user impact and mission outcomes.  
* Don’t wait for a contract issue to escalate — call attention to delivery concerns too.  
* Promote a learning culture: it's okay to pivot if risks reveal that the current approach isn’t working.

**Why it matters:** Digital service delivery carries inherent uncertainty. Strong leaders normalize **responsive, adaptive decision-making** over rigid adherence to original plans.

## Micro-Actions that Shape Culture

Even small choices send strong signals about what matters. Consider the contrast in tone and focus across these common moments:

| Moment | Project-aligned action | Product-aligned action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Kickoff meeting | "We have a 12-month roadmap" | "We’ll deliver iteratively, starting with what we know and adjusting as we learn" |
| Reviewing a demo | "Looks good" | "What user problem does this solve?" |
| Progress update to leadership | "All milestones are green" | "Here’s what we’ve learned, and what we’re testing next." |
| Team conflict about delivery | "Let’s stick to the original plan" | "Let’s pause and revisit the outcome we’re trying to reach" |

**Takeaway:** Every interaction, big or small, is a chance to reinforce a culture of learning, iteration, and user focus. Leading by example means showing others what good looks like.
