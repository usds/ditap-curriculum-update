# Avoiding Bias in Vendor Evaluations

To fulfill your mandate for modern, equitable, and effective public service delivery, vendor evaluations must be fair, inclusive, and outcomes-focused. Bias in the evaluation process not only threatens program performance but also risks undermining innovation, competition, and trust in government. 

## Limit Opportunities for Bias

Your engagement in shaping fair and effective evaluation processes is not merely operational; it’s transformational. It signals a commitment to stewardship, innovation, and the public good. 

* Insist on criteria that reflect project outcomes.  
  * Direct your teams to define and use evaluation criteria aligned with your agency’s strategic priorities, such as user impact, accessibility, delivery agility, and security, rather than relying on compliance or technical jargon.  
* Mandate multidisciplinary evaluation panels.  
  * Champion cross-functional evaluation teams that bring together policy, program, IT, acquisition, and user experience perspectives. Diverse viewpoints reduce blind spots and help align decisions with real-world impact.  
* Require independent scoring before group deliberation.  
  * Ensure that individual reviewers assess proposals or demos independently before discussing them with one another. This promotes integrity in scoring and protects against the influence of dominant voices, groupthink, or group dynamics.  
* Support the use of anonymous or “blind” reviews.  
  * Where feasible, require removal of vendor-identifying details during early assessments. This levels the playing field and encourages merit-based decisions.  
* Institute bias mitigation training.  
  * Equip evaluators with tools to recognize and mitigate cognitive bias—sponsor briefings or refreshers as part of the acquisition readiness.  
* Promote demonstrated capability over familiarity.  
  * Encourage solution-focused evaluations, such as prototype reviews or live demos tied to real user needs, rather than overemphasizing familiarity or past contracts.   
* Ensure equitable access to the market.  
  * Set the tone by prioritizing open competition and challenging procurement defaults that exclude newer entrants or non-traditional vendors.  
* Require post-evaluation analysis.  
  * Make it standard practice to review award patterns and identify whether unintentional bias may have influenced outcomes. Utilize these findings to enhance future solicitations and foster greater transparency.
