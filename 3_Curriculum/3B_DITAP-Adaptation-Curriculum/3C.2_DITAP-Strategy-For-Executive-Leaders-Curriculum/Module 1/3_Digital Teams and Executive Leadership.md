# Digital Teams and Executive Leadership
Research demonstrates that executive leadership commitment is the primary predictor of digital transformation success. Organizations with committed executive champions achieve their digital goals 70% more often than those without. Committed leadership means providing air cover for teams to experiment and fail fast, making rapid decisions to remove bureaucratic obstacles, and consistently communicating the vision and urgency for change.

Traditional government leadership approaches emphasize risk avoidance, hierarchical decision-making, and comprehensive planning. In contrast, digital transformation requires calculated risk-taking, distributed decision-making, and adaptive planning. This shift doesn't abandon accountability, it creates accountability structures that support rapid learning and course correction.</br>

**Leadership behaviors that enable success:**
- **Providing strategic air cover:** Protecting teams from bureaucratic interference while maintaining appropriate oversight.
- **Rapid decision-making:** Making decisions with incomplete information and adjusting the course based on evidence.
- **Vision communication:** Consistently articulating why digital transformation matters to the mission.
- **Resource allocation:** Investing in talent, tools, and training that enable digital delivery.
- **Cultural modeling:** Demonstrating comfort with uncertainty and iterative improvement.

**Leadership anti-patterns that derail digital initiatives:**
- Requiring comprehensive upfront planning for inherently uncertain work.
- Micromanaging team processes instead of focusing on outcomes.
- Treating digital initiatives as traditional IT projects.
- Failing to invest in organizational change management.
- Avoiding difficult conversations with stakeholders resistant to change.

The leader's role shifts from directing work to removing obstacles, from approving plans to enabling teams, and from managing compliance to ensuring outcomes. This requires different skills and mindsets, but organizations that make this transition dramatically outperform their peers.

Agile software doesn’t work without the involvement of all team members, including leadership. A cross-functional or Integrated Product Team (IPT) is integral to the success and administration of Agile software development. The agile team must include key stakeholders from the program and acquisition offices. It should be led by a program manager holding the appropriate level of Federal Acquisition Certification in Program or Project Management. A successful agile team serves as a champion for agile practices within their organization and across the government, in conjunction with leaders who also serve as champions for the team.

## Example Team Members and Roles
Government:
- Product Owner (PO):
    - Responsible for maximizing the value delivered by the team and ensuring the Team Backlog is aligned with customer and stakeholder needs.
- QA/Tester:
    - A government user who tests the system's features and functionality.
- Contracting Officer (CO):
    - Authorized to bind the Government contractually and direct contractor action.
- Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR):
    - Performs functions specifically delegated to them, in writing, by the CO for the particular contract or order. This individual may also serve as the Product Owner.
- Product Manager (PdM):
    - Government manager of the agile process. Sometimes called the Product Owner. 
 - Legal:
    - Provides legal review of all documents and actions.
- Developers:
    - Software architects who design the system and write code.
- Designers:
    - Responsible for user research, wireframes and prototypes, designing the workflow, and defining critical structures.
- Project Manager (PjM):
    - Manages the team’s execution of the project.
- QA/Tester:
    - Test a system's features and functionality to identify software bugs in both functional and non-functional areas, ensuring the system's overall reliability and performance.

## Best Practices for Team Composition
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to forming a team. Here are some considerations to help make the most of your agency’s available talent resources.
- Each requirement should be individually assessed to see which roles are or are not needed.
- Some roles are only needed during specific stages of the requirement and may roll on or off.
- Some federal agencies, such as the United States Digital Service, have team members who can fill contractor roles.
- Developers and testers should be cross-functional individuals who can work in either position.
- Automated testing is encouraged, and testers can write and run automated tests, supplemented with exploratory testing.

## Executive Decision-Making Framework for Digital Transformation
You make dozens of decisions daily that either accelerate or hinder digital transformation. Here's a practical framework for executive choices:

**The Five-Question Decision Filter**

When teams bring you digital transformation decisions, apply these questions in order:
1. Mission impact: Does this directly improve outcomes for the people we serve?
    - If yes, proceed to question 2
    - If no, it requires more vigorous justification.
2. Learning value: What will we learn that improves future decisions?
    - High learning value = proceed even with higher risk.
    - Low learning value = requires clearer ROI.
3. Failure cost: What happens if this doesn't work as planned?
    - Catastrophic failure = redesign approach.
    - Manageable failure = acceptable risk for potential gain.
4. Speed to value: How quickly will we see results?
    - Fast feedback loops are preferred over long-term bets.
    - Balance quick wins with strategic investments.
5. Resource efficiency: Is this the best use of our limited capability?
    - Consider the opportunity cost of not doing something else.
    - Ensure alignment with strategic priorities.

## Decision Scenarios for Executives

**Scenario 1:** Team requests permission to experiment with new technology
- Traditional response: "Show me a detailed plan with guaranteed outcomes."
- Digital leadership response: "What will we learn, how much will it cost, and how quickly will we know if it's working?"

**Scenario 2:** Vendor proposes a comprehensive solution
- Traditional response: "This looks complete and reduces risk."
- Digital leadership response: "How can we break this into smaller pieces and test the most uncertain assumptions first?"

**Scenario 3:** Stakeholder demands a detailed timeline
- Traditional response: "We'll create a comprehensive project plan."
- Digital leadership response: "Here's what we'll deliver in the first 90 days, and here's how we'll learn what to do next.”</br>

## Resource Allocation Strategy

**The 70-20-10 Rule for digital investment:**</br>
- 70%: Proven approaches that deliver predictable value.
- 20%: Emerging practices with strong evidence from other agencies.
- 10%: Experimental approaches with high learning potential.

**Budget allocation principles:**
- Fund teams and capabilities, not just projects.
- Invest in learning before scaling.
- Reserve 15-20% of the IT budget for modernization initiatives.
- Create dedicated funding for rapid experimentation.

**Talent investment priorities:**
- Product management capability (highest ROI).
- User research and design skills.
- Modern engineering practices.
- Data analysis and measurement capability.
- Agile coaching and change management.

## Overcoming Institutional Barriers
**Common barriers and executive responses:**
- "We need more detailed requirements."
    - Response: "Let's start with user needs and discover requirements through building."
- "This doesn't follow our standard process."
    - Response: "Our standard process wasn't designed for digital services. Let's pilot a better approach."
- "What if this fails?"
    - Response: "What if we keep doing what's already failing? Let's design smart experiments with limited downside."
- "Oversight requires comprehensive documentation."
    - Response: "Let's show oversight bodies working software and user feedback instead of documents."

**Your authority to change the game:**
- Modify governance processes to support iteration.
- Create new performance metrics focused on outcomes.
- Establish direct communication channels between teams and users.
- Protect teams from organizational antibodies that resist change.
- Model digital leadership behaviors consistently.</br>
