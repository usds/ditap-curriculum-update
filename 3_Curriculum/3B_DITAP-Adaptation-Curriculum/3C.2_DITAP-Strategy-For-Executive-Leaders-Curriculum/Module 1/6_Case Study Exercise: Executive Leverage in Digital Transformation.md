### Module 1 Exercise Instructions Answer Key
**_Part A: Competing Values Assessment (20 minutes)_** 

**1. Character quadrant analysis - detailed answers:**
- Yvette (Program Manager) - Yellow quadrant analysis:
    - What drives her decisions: Team harmony and inclusive decision-making above all else. She prioritizes ensuring that everyone feels heard and supported, even if it means compromising on decision speed. Her opening reflection on the "positive program review" focuses entirely on the collaborative process rather than outcomes achieved.
    - Evidence from case: "Connection before content" practice, emphasis on "we all supported each other and listened to all voices," concern that Roman's structure proposal would "hamper our team's collaborative vibe," and her surprise at the emerging conflict ("she didn't see anyone talking like this last week").
    - Strengths: Creates psychological safety, builds trust and relationships, ensures diverse perspectives are included, and maintains team morale during difficult periods.
    - Blind spots: May delay critical decisions to achieve consensus, can avoid necessary conflict that would improve outcomes, and may prioritize team harmony over mission effectiveness.

- Roman (Contracting Officer) - Red quadrant analysis:
    - What are his primary concerns: Policy compliance, predictable processes, and risk mitigation through systematic approaches. He seeks "approved plans" and "locked-in" processes to eliminate ambiguity and ensure legal sufficiency.
    - Evidence from case: Emphasis on "approved plan with milestones and predictable structure," concern about TRL requirements ("anything below TRL 7 is too risky"), preference for "traditional, monolithic contracts" because "the FAR gives specific guidance," and worry about protests.
    - Strengths: Ensures legal sufficiency, creates systematic approaches, manages compliance risk, and provides stability and predictability.
    - Blind spots: May overemphasize process compliance over mission outcomes, be resistant to innovation that doesn't fit established patterns, and may confuse guidance with requirements.

 - Greg (Chief Engineer) - Green quadrant analysis:
    - What motivates his approach: Innovation, experimentation, and exploring new technological possibilities. He thrives on uncertainty and views "playing around" as essential learning rather than a frivolous activity.
    - Evidence from case: Wants to "experiment with a series of prototypes," argues that "playing around is exactly what we should do," advocates for modular contracting and rapid prototyping, references emerging technologies like "Middle Tier of Acquisition pathway."
    - Strengths: Drives innovation, adapts quickly to new technologies, is creative in problem-solving, and challenges conventional approaches.
    - Blind spots: May underestimate implementation challenges, moves quickly between ideas without fully developing previous ones, may dismiss legitimate process concerns.

- Barb (User Representative) - Blue quadrant analysis:
    - What she prioritizes: Results, speed, competitive advantage, and mission outcomes above all process considerations. Her email demonstrates impatience with internal debates when users need solutions.
    - Evidence from case: "Swift delivery is crucial," "maintain a competitive edge in the fight for people's health," "accelerated timeline," "I don't care if you use old acquisition strategies or new ones... I care about getting the job done.” "Our ability to win hinges on timely implementation."
    - Strengths: Maintains focus on mission outcomes, drives urgency, competitive awareness, and user advocacy.
    - Blind spots: May sacrifice quality for speed, can be impatient with necessary processes, and may underestimate the complexity of implementation.

_2. Current organizational position analysis:_
- Primary quadrant: Yellow (Collaborate)
    - Supporting evidence: Team practices "connection before content," emphasis on everyone having a voice, Yvette's pride in how "well the team works together," focus on "outstanding off-site events," and team friendship.
    - Additional indicators include consensus-seeking decision-making, conflict avoidance, an emphasis on inclusive participation, and a sense of surprise when tensions emerge.

_3. Risk and opportunity analysis:_

Risks of staying in the yellow quadrant:
- Decision paralysis: Consensus-seeking may prevent timely decisions needed for mission success.
- False consensus: Agreement that "is not correct," as Roman warns.
- Mission delay: Healthcare outcomes suffer while the team debates internally.
- Stakeholder frustration: Users like Barb become impatient with the internal process focus.
- Competitive disadvantage: Other organizations move faster while this team deliberates.

Opportunities from shifting quadrants:
- Blue shift: Rapid delivery to meet urgent healthcare needs, competitive advantage, clear accountability.
- Green shift: Innovation in AI technology, breakthrough solutions, technological leadership.
- Red shift: Systematic risk management, compliant processes, predictable outcomes.
- Integrated approach: Combine strengths from all quadrants for a comprehensive solution.

**_Part B: Leadership Influence Strategy (25 minutes)_** 

1. Personal leadership assessment - framework for responses:
    - Identification method: Teams should use the CVF questions ("How can we support each other?" = Yellow, "What haven't we tried yet?" = Green, "How can we be more efficient?" = Red, "How can we outperform the rest?" = Blue)
    - Honest reflection: Facilitators should encourage participants to identify their genuine preferences, not what they think they should prefer.
    - Behavioral evidence: Ask for specific examples of how they've acted in similar situations.
    - Comfort zone recognition: Identify which quadrant feels most natural and which feels most challenging.

2. Strategic quadrant shift - detailed analysis:
- Blue quadrant priority (Recommended):
    - Justification: Barb's urgency reflects a genuine mission-criticality - healthcare outcomes are at stake, and delay costs lives. The competitive healthcare environment demands rapid innovation and delivery.
    - Implementation strategy: Establish clear outcome-focused metrics, create rapid decision-making processes, implement competitive benchmarking, and focus on user value delivery.
Executive actions: Provide air cover for rapid decision-making, remove bureaucratic barriers, establish outcome-based accountability, and protect teams from process-focused criticism.

3. Implementation strategy - specific actions:
- Executive influence mechanisms:
    - Resource allocation: Direct budget and staffing decisions toward chosen quadrant priorities.
    - Policy modification: Change organizational policies that obstruct the chosen approach.
    - Cultural modeling: Demonstrate desired behaviors personally and reward them in others.
    - Communication strategy: Articulate vision that connects chosen approach to mission success.
    - Barrier removal: Eliminate organizational obstacles that prevent effective implementation.

4. Modular contracting alignment - integration strategy:
 -Blue quadrant support:
    - Parallel development: Multiple vendors can work simultaneously, accelerating overall delivery.
    - Competitive pressure: Vendors compete for additional modules based on performance.
    - Rapid iteration: Smaller contracts enable faster feedback and course correction.
    - Risk reduction: Failures in one module don't compromise the entire system.
- Executive leadership role:
    - Vision communication: Articulate how modular contracting serves mission needs.
    - Resource commitment: Provide necessary resources for product management and integration.
    - Organizational support: Modify policies and processes to support modular approaches.
    - Cultural change: Model and reward collaborative vendor relationships.
