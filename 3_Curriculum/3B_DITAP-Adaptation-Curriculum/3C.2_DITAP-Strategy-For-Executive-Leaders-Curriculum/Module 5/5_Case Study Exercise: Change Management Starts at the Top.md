# Case Study Exercise: Change Management Starts at the Top

**Applying Change Leadership: Project RAINBO Integration**

The exercises that follow integrate your learning about organizational incentives, monolithic-to-modular transition, and cultural transformation. You'll practice:

* **Analyzing incentive systems** that either enable or hinder digital transformation.  
* **Developing change strategies** that address both formal and informal organizational barriers.  
* **Creating storytelling approaches** that resonate with different stakeholder values and concerns.  
* **Planning systematic transitions** from traditional to modern approaches. 
* **Leading cultural transformation** that enables sustained organizational change.

As you work through these exercises, focus on your role as a change leader:

* What incentive misalignments are preventing successful change?  
* How will you systematically transition from current to desired state?  
* What cultural barriers need your direct intervention and modeling?  
* How will you sustain change momentum through inevitable challenges?

**Scenario setup:** Project RAINBO has reached a critical juncture. The team must transition from their current collaborative approach to a more decisive, outcome-focused model. You are the executive leadership team responsible for managing this organizational change.

### Audience-Specific Story Development 

For Roman (Red quadrant) \- Complete Story Framework:

The Challenge: "Our current approach creates unpredictable risks and inefficiencies that threaten both project success and our professional reputation. We're seeing delays that compromise mission outcomes, processes that create more problems than they solve, and approaches that expose us to unnecessary risks. If we don't change, we'll continue to see project failures, stakeholder frustration, and potential compliance issues that could have serious consequences for our careers and our organization."

The Vision: "We can build a more reliable, efficient system through structured change management that improves both compliance and outcomes. Imagine having processes that are both innovative and compliant, decisions that are both fast and thorough, and approaches that reduce risk while improving effectiveness. We'll have predictable processes, clear accountability, and demonstrated success that protects both our mission and our professional reputation."

The Path: "We'll achieve this through careful planning, phased implementation, and continuous monitoring. Each change will be thoroughly analyzed, properly documented, and systematically implemented. We'll maintain all compliance requirements while improving efficiency. Legal counsel will be involved at every step, and we'll have robust monitoring systems to ensure we stay on track. This isn't about taking reckless risks—it's about taking intelligent, managed risks that serve our mission."

The Role: "Your expertise in risk management and process improvement will be critical for ensuring we do this right. You'll lead the development of risk management frameworks, ensure compliance throughout the process, and help us build processes that are both innovative and responsible. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that government can be both cutting-edge and compliant, both fast and thorough. Your contribution will be essential to our success and will position you as a leader in responsible innovation."

For Greg (Green quadrant) \- Complete Story Framework:

The Challenge: "We're missing opportunities for innovation and breakthrough solutions that could transform how government serves people. Current approaches prevent us from exploring new technologies, implementing creative solutions, or taking advantage of emerging opportunities. We're falling behind while others innovate, and we're solving yesterday's problems with yesterday's approaches. If we don't change, we'll continue to miss breakthrough opportunities and fail to achieve our full potential."

The Vision: "This change will unlock our creative potential and enable cutting-edge solutions that put us at the forefront of government innovation. We'll have the freedom to experiment, the resources to innovate, and the support to try new approaches. We'll be known as the team that brings breakthrough solutions to government challenges, and we'll have the competitive advantage that comes from being first with innovative approaches."

The Path: "We'll create structured opportunities for experimentation and rapid prototyping within a framework that ensures success. You'll have dedicated time and resources for innovation, protection from criticism when intelligent experiments don't work, and support for bringing successful innovations to scale. We'll balance creative freedom with appropriate structure, ensuring that innovation serves our mission."

The Role: "You'll lead our innovation efforts and help others see new possibilities. You'll have ownership of cutting-edge technology implementation, responsibility for breakthrough solution development, and the opportunity to mentor others in innovative approaches. This is your chance to prove that government can be as innovative as the private sector and to build solutions that truly transform how we serve people."

For Yvette (Yellow quadrant) \- Complete Story Framework:

The Challenge: "Team frustration and conflict are undermining the collaboration we've built and preventing us from achieving our mission effectively. Current approaches create tension rather than resolving it, and our desire to avoid conflict is actually creating more problems. People are becoming frustrated, relationships are strained, and we're not serving our mission as effectively as we could. If we don't change, we'll continue to see team effectiveness decline and mission impact suffer."

The Vision: "These changes will create a more supportive, effective team environment where everyone can contribute their best work. We'll maintain our collaborative culture while improving our decision-making effectiveness. Team members will feel heard and valued, but we'll also achieve better outcomes. We'll have the best of both worlds—strong relationships and high performance."

The Path: "We'll maintain our collaborative culture while improving our effectiveness through better processes and clearer roles. Everyone will still have input, but we'll have more efficient ways to incorporate feedback and make decisions. We'll build on our relationship strengths while developing new capabilities for effective leadership and decision-making."

The Role: "Your relationship skills will be essential for helping the team navigate this transition successfully. You'll help communicate changes, support team members through the transition, and ensure that our collaborative culture is maintained while we improve our effectiveness. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that great leaders can be both collaborative and effective, both supportive and decisive."

For Barb (Blue quadrant) \- Complete Story Framework:

The Challenge: "Delays and inefficiencies are preventing us from achieving mission-critical outcomes that people depend on. Current approaches are too slow, too bureaucratic, and too focused on internal processes rather than results. People are suffering while we debate internally, and we're losing the competitive advantage we need to serve our mission effectively. If we don't change, we'll continue to fall behind while people's needs go unmet."

The Vision: "This change will accelerate delivery and improve our competitive position, enabling us to achieve breakthrough outcomes that truly serve people's needs. We'll have the speed and agility to respond to urgent requirements, the efficiency to deliver more with less, and the effectiveness to achieve outcomes that make a real difference. We'll be known as the team that gets things done and delivers results."

The Path: "We'll implement focused execution and clear accountability systems that drive rapid progress toward outcomes. Decision-making will be streamlined, processes will be optimized for speed, and everyone will be accountable for results. We'll maintain quality while dramatically improving our delivery speed and effectiveness."

The Role: "You'll keep us focused on outcomes and push for the speed and effectiveness we need to succeed. You'll challenge us to move faster, hold us accountable for results, and ensure that we never lose sight of the people we're serving. Your pressure for results will be essential for driving the urgency and effectiveness we need to achieve our mission."
