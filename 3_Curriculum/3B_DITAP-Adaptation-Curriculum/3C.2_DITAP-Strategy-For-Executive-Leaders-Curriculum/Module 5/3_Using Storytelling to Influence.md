# Using Storytelling to Influence

Using storytelling as a senior government leader is a powerful way to shape procurement strategies, especially in environments such as government, where culture, precedent, and risk aversion often prevail. Stories make abstract principles tangible, unite stakeholders behind a shared vision, and create a sense of urgency for change. 

You know what doesn't work? Explaining why "agile acquisition methodologies optimize procurement lifecycles." People's eyes glaze over. You've lost them.

Do you know what works? Telling them about Maria, the veteran who waited eight months for benefits because your system couldn't handle the paperwork. And how everything changed when you started building software differently.

Stories don't just communicate information; they make abstract concepts real and urgent. As a senior leader, your stories shape how people think about what's possible.

## Best Practices

**Anchor stories in mission and impact**:

* Frame procurement as a mission-critical function rather than an “overhead” or “non-value-added” function, which is often the prevailing perception at many agencies. Tie procurement reforms or digital modernization efforts to real-life outcomes, like a faster Veteran benefits application or more secure disaster relief payments.  
* Use human-centered examples. Share stories of actual users, like citizens, service members, and field staff, who were affected by a broken or improved procurement process.  
  * **Start with a real person facing a fundamental problem**: "Maria, a veteran applying for disability benefits, submitted her paperwork in January. In September, she was still waiting."  
  * **Make the consequences tangible**: "While Maria waited, she couldn't pay for her medications. Our call center was getting 500 calls a day from veterans in similar situations."  
  * **Show how a different approach changed everything**: "We used modular contracting to rebuild the application system in 12-week chunks. We tested each piece with real veterans before building the next."  
  * **Connect to the human impact**: "Maria's application now takes three weeks instead of eight months. Veteran satisfaction scores went up 40%."  
  * **Draw the broader lesson**: "This approach didn't just help Maria—it showed us how modular contracting lets us deliver mission value faster and more reliably."

**Translate strategy into narrative arcs**:

* Use the classic arc: Problem \> Tension \> Solution \> Outcome.  
  * Problem: Identify the ineffective procurement that’s blocking delivery.  
  * Tension: Risk, urgency, or opportunity that’s being missed as a result.   
  * Solution: A new procurement method, a cross-functional team, or a partnership that will alleviate the tensions.  
  * Outcome: The mission value delivered, risk reduced, or innovation realized from the solution.  
    

**Showcase risk-informed successes**:

* Tell stories of strategic, thoughtful risk-taking, not recklessness. Embrace solving for potential risks rather than avoiding a solution, as risks may still occur.  
* Emphasize how data, user research, or pilots helped your agency reduce risk and succeed. Discuss failures and how your pivots realigned the deliverables based on user feedback.   
* Propose risk mitigation, not risk elimination. Emphasize documenting decisions, pilot approaches, flexible clauses, and modular scopes as ways to mitigate risks rather than attempting to eliminate them.


**Highlight the people behind the procurement**:

* Elevate the role of the CO, legal counsel, engineers, or user researchers as problem solvers.   
* Help your agency visualize procurement as a team-based, creative, and collaborative process, rather than just a compliance-driven one. Focus on the outcomes and the team's innovative approach.


**Use before-and-after contrasts**:

* Compare an old procurement method or process with a modern, user-centered one. Complete a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis for both and compare the results.  
* Make the contrast visceral: costs, timelines, satisfaction, speed to mission, etc.


**Tell “hero stories” about procurement innovation**:

* Profile leaders or teams who broke through bureaucracy to deliver impact.  
* Focus on character traits such as courage, curiosity, empathy, and persistence.  
* Use these stories to shift the culture from gatekeeping to one that enables.

**Use numbers to amplify emotion, not replace it:**

* Data without context is just statistics. Data that shows human impact becomes compelling evidence.  
* "We reduced procurement cycle time by 60%" is a metric. "We reduced procurement cycle time by 60%, which means citizens get help six months faster" is a story.  
* Always connect your quantitative results to qualitative impact. Show how faster procurement translates to better outcomes for real people.

**Align stories with strategic imperatives**:

* Connect your stories to your agency’s strategic goals, OMB initiatives, or executive mandates. This positions your procurement approach as an enabler, not a silo. 

**Make complex stuff simple:**

* "Modular contracting" is jargon. "Building software in pieces so we can fix problems quickly" is something anyone can understand.  
* Instead of: "We're implementing agile acquisition methodologies to optimize our procurement lifecycle." Try: "We're changing how we buy technology so our teams can fix problems in weeks instead of waiting years for new contracts."

**Address resistance with empathy:**

* Some of the most substantial resistance comes from individuals whose failed technology projects have burned. They're not being difficult—they're protecting the mission and their careers from what they see as unnecessary risk.  
* Acknowledge their concerns: "I understand why large, comprehensive contracts feel safer—we've all seen technology projects fail. But here's what we learned when we tried a different approach..."  
* Show how new methods reduce the risks they're worried about. Don't dismiss their concerns as outdated thinking; instead, consider them.

Storytelling turns abstract ideas into relatable concepts and brings a personal investment into the conversation. It turns procurement into “a day in the life” stories or personal anecdotes. Storytelling can also reveal the hidden costs of slow or ineffective procurement, including missed opportunities, stakeholder frustration, and wasted taxpayer dollars. Share these stories across your agency's channels and empower others to share their own stories. 

## Leading Cultural Transformation for Digital Innovation

Culture change is the most challenging aspect of digital transformation, yet it's also the most crucial. You can implement new technologies and processes, but without cultural change, people will find ways to make the new approaches work like the old ones.

## Understanding Digital Culture vs. Traditional Government Culture

**Traditional government culture characteristics**:

* Risk avoidance and failure prevention  
* Process compliance and following established procedures  
* Hierarchical decision-making and approval processes  
* Internal focus and stakeholder management  
* Individual accountability and specialized roles

**Digital innovation culture characteristics**:

* Intelligent risk management and learning from failures  
* Outcome optimization and user-centered decision-making  
* Distributed decision-making and empowered teams  
* External focus and user advocacy  
* Shared accountability and cross-functional collaboration

**The transformation challenge**: Navigating between these cultures requires shifting how people perceive risk, success, and their role within the organization.

## The Four Pillars of Cultural Transformation
<img width="1226" height="996" alt="the four pillars of cultural transformation" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db6d8a5a-d746-4085-9981-71c85580b169" />


**Pillar 1: Mindset Shift from Risk Avoidance to Risk Management**

**Current state**: "The best approach is the one with the lowest risk." 

**Target state**: "The best approach balances risk with potential reward and impact."

**Executive actions**:

* Model intelligent risk-taking by trying new approaches publicly.  
* Share stories of successful innovation that came from initial failures.  
* Distinguish between reckless risks and intelligent experiments.  
* Protect teams who take thoughtful risks, even when results aren't perfect.

**Behavioral changes**:

* Teams propose innovative solutions rather than defaulting to traditional approaches.  
* Failures are analyzed for learning rather than blame assignment.  
* Risk discussions focus on mitigation strategies rather than avoidance.  
* Decision-making considers both action risks and inaction risks.

**Pillar 2: Focus Shift from Process Compliance to Outcome Achievement**

**Current state**: "Success means following procedures correctly." 

**Target state**: "Success means achieving mission outcomes for users."

**Executive actions**:

* Change performance metrics to emphasize outcomes over process compliance.  
* Ask "What did users get?" instead of "Did we follow the process?"  
* Recognize teams that achieve outcomes through innovative approaches.  
* Modify approval processes to focus on outcome probability rather than process perfection.

**Behavioral changes**:

* Teams optimize for user value rather than process compliance.  
* Discussions focus on impact and effectiveness rather than procedure adherence.  
* Innovation is valued when it improves outcomes, even if it challenges existing processes.  
* Success stories emphasize mission achievement rather than compliance records.

**Pillar 3: Authority Shift from Hierarchical to Distributed Decision-Making**

**Current state**: "Important decisions must be made at the top." 

**Target state**: "Decisions should be made by those closest to the information and impact."

**Executive actions**:

* Delegate decision-making authority to teams closest to users and problems.  
* Create clear boundaries for distributed decision-making.  
* Support team decisions even when you might have chosen differently.  
* Ask "Who has the best information to make this decision?" rather than "Who has the authority?"

**Behavioral changes**:

* Teams make day-to-day decisions without extensive approval processes.  
* Information flows to decision-makers rather than decisions flowing to information.  
* Authority is earned through expertise and proximity to problems rather than the organizational level.  
* Escalation is used for resource conflicts and strategic alignment, not operational decisions.

**Pillar 4: Accountability Shift from Individual to Shared Team Accountability**

**Current state**: "Individuals are responsible for their specific deliverables." 

**Target state**: "Teams are collectively responsible for user outcomes."

**Executive actions**:

* Create team-based performance metrics and recognition systems.  
* Hold teams accountable for collective outcomes rather than individual deliverables.  
* Remove organizational barriers that prevent cross-functional collaboration.  
* Model collaborative problem-solving in your own leadership approach.

**Behavioral changes**:

* Teams collaborate to solve problems rather than defending individual domains.  
* Success and failure are shared rather than attributed to individuals.  
* Knowledge and resources are shared freely rather than hoarded.  
* Organizational boundaries become permeable rather than protective.
