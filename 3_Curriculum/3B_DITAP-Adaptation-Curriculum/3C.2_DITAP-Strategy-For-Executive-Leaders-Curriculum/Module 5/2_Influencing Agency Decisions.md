# Influencing Agency Decisions

As a leader in your agency, your influence goes beyond individual procurements. You shape the culture, priorities, and strategic direction of your agency. Through leadership techniques, you can influence change, foster innovation, and promote collaboration and agile teaming. 

Your position as a senior government leader gives you the unique power to transform how your agency approaches digital procurement. You're not just managing individual contracts, you're shaping the entire ecosystem that determines whether technology serves your mission or holds it back.

## Use Your Authority to Change the Game

You control more than you realize. Here's how to use that power:

* **Change what you fund**: Invest in discovery phases and pilot projects. When teams see you're willing to invest in learning, they'll try new things.  
* **Change what you measure**: If you only track cost and schedule, you'll get projects that meet those metrics but fail to meet user needs. Start asking, "What did we learn?" and "How are users responding?"  
* **Change your meetings**: Turn your acquisition reviews from compliance checkpoints into learning sessions. Ask different questions. Celebrate innovative experiments, not just successful execution.  
* **Change who gets recognized**: Make it clear that intelligent experimentation is valued. When people see you celebrating teams that try new approaches and learn from failures, they'll take more thoughtful risks.

**Work the informal network \-** Every organization has two power structures: the org chart and the real influence network. The person who's been handling contracts for 20 years might not have a fancy title, but they have credibility. The program manager everyone respects can amplify your message better than any directive.

Figure out who these people are. Invest in those relationships. When they become advocates for change, they'll convince people you could never reach.

**Use your position to influence external partners \-** set the tone with industry and oversight partners.

* Host industry days that explicitly signal interest in agile and modular approaches.  
* Encourage vendors to demonstrate working software and focus on outcomes rather than just resumes.  
* Work with IGs, GAO, or legal counsel to ensure compliance doesn’t inhibit innovation.

## How to Influence Your Agency's Procurement Decisions

Look, you didn't become a senior leader to manage the status quo. You're here because you want to make things better. And right now, your agency's procurement processes are probably driving everyone crazy, including you.

Here's the thing: you have more power to change this than you think. You're not just managing individual contracts; you're managing a comprehensive portfolio of contracts. You're shaping whether technology helps or holds back your mission.

**Start with “Why this matters”:** Before you try to convince anyone else, get crystal clear on why this matters to your agency. And I'm not talking about "digital transformation" or "modernizing legacy systems." I'm talking about real impact.

What happens when your veterans wait eight months for benefits because your system can't handle the load? What happens when your disaster response teams can't coordinate because their software doesn't talk to each other? What happens when your staff spend 40% of their time on manual processes that could be automated?

That's your starting point. Not the technology—the human impact.

**Lead with a strategic narrative:** Frame digital procurement modernization as essential to your agency’s mission success, not just IT reform.

* Tell a compelling story. Link procurement modernization to real public service outcomes.  
* Make it about risk management: position modular contracting as a tool to reduce risk, not increase it.  
* Align your narrative with high-level priorities: Tie your message to OMB priorities, the Digital Services Playbook, the President’s Management Agenda, or your agency's goals. 

**Champion modular contracts**: promote modular contracting as a strategic best practice.

* Encourage the use of modular or phased contracting approaches to facilitate flexibility and efficiency.  
* Highlight success stories across your agency.  
* Support early adopters by recognizing the teams that pilot modular approaches. Help remove internal roadblocks for them. 

**Shape evaluation and governance structures**: develop acquisition strategies, governance reviews, and program oversight to favor flexibility and outcomes over size and rigidity.

* Shift performance conversations to focus on iteration, user feedback loops, and technical flexibility rather than just cost and scope.  
*  Require cross-functional participation in reviews by involving digital experts, users, and product owners in acquisition decisions. 

**Use metrics that incentivize innovation**: measure what matters for modern procurement outcomes. Move beyond cost and schedule as metrics.

* Track time to first delivery, user satisfaction, number of iterations before rollout, and reduction in cycle time through modular design, in addition to cost and schedule.  
* Share these metrics upward to create a results-focused, data-driven procurement culture.

**Create or support internal digital service teams**: build or align with internal teams that can experiment with new procurement models.

* Provide executive sponsorship for pilot projects.  
* Give these teams room to try, fail, and learn from their mistakes. Ensure their learning and progress are visible to others.  
* Use these projects as proof points to scale modular approaches agency-wide.

## Build Your Team Before You Need Them

Change doesn't happen because you send a memo. It happens because people decide to make it happen. Therefore, you should find your allies before you need them.

Consider who in your organization is already dissatisfied with the current workflow. The program manager is tired of waiting two years for simple software updates. The contracting officer who knows there's a better way but doesn't have air cover to try it, the technical lead who sees what's possible but can't get approval to experiment.

These people become your champions. Start having coffee with them. Ask what's driving them crazy. Listen to their ideas. When they see you're serious about change, they'll help you make it happen.

**Empower your procurement and program staff** by investing in training and tools that instill confidence in your staff, who need to operate within a modern procurement model.

* Support DITAP certification for key personnel.  
* Sponsor joint learning sessions between program, legal, and contracting staff of agile, modular procurement, and product thinking. Promote lunch-and-learn and train-the-trainer opportunities.  
* Fund tools and support, such as acquisition coaching, technical advisors, or contract writing support, focused on digital service delivery. 


**Create or support internal digital service teams**: build or align with internal teams that can experiment with new procurement models.

* Provide executive sponsorship for pilot projects.  
* Give these teams room to try, fail, and learn from their mistakes. Ensure their learning and progress are visible to others.  
* Use these projects as proof points to scale modular approaches agency-wide.

## Create Stories, Not Just Pilot Projects

The difference between a pilot and a proof of concept is what you do with the results. Pilots create reports that sit on shelves. Proof points create stories that change minds.

When you sponsor new approaches, document not just what happened but why it mattered. How did that modular contract help you respond when the user's needs changed? What would have happened with a traditional approach? These stories become your most powerful tools for influencing other leaders.

## Stop Trying to Eliminate Risk—Start Managing It

Assessing is where most government leaders tend to get stuck. They think their job is to eliminate risk, so they create processes that are so rigid they guarantee failure. You can't eliminate risk. You can only manage it.

When discussing new approaches with others, lead with how you'll handle potential issues that may arise. Don't say "this is risk-free." Say, "Here's how we'll catch problems early and fix them fast."

Use phrases like "we're reducing risk through iteration" instead of "we're trying something risky." Show how modular contracts let you course-correct instead of betting everything on one big decision.

**Encourage agile budgeting and phased funding** by aligning budget strategies with the principles of modular contracting.

* Advocate for incremental funding and discovery phases within IT investment plans to ensure effective allocation of resources.  
* Work with CFOs and OMB liaisons to avoid “big bang” funding that forces rigid contracts.  
* Promote reviews that allow pivoting or stopping failing efforts.


## Understanding and Reshaping Organizational Incentives

Your organization's formal and informal incentive systems either enable or hinder digital transformation. Most executives underestimate the powerfully shaping influence of these systems, often wondering why people resist change when the incentives reward the old ways of working.

## The Dual Incentive System

Every organization operates two incentive systems simultaneously:

**Formal incentives** (What we say we reward):

* Performance evaluation criteria and promotion requirements  
* Budget allocation and resource distribution processes  
* Official recognition and award systems  
* Written policies and stated organizational values

**Informal incentives** (What we reward):

* Peer approval and social status within teams  
* Risk tolerance and consequences of failure  
* Workload management and stress avoidance  
* Career safety and job security perceptions

**The gap problem**: Digital transformation fails when formal incentives encourage innovation while informal incentives punish risk-taking.

## Common Incentive Misalignments

**Innovation vs. risk aversion**

* **Formal message**: "We value innovation and creative problem-solving."  
* **Informal reality**: People who try new approaches and fail face career consequences.  
* **Behavioral result**: Teams choose safe, traditional approaches even when they know better options exist.

**Speed vs. process compliance**

* **Formal message**: "Deliver value quickly to serve users better."  
* **Informal reality**: Promotions go to people who follow every process perfectly, regardless of outcomes.  
* **Behavioral result**: Teams optimize for process compliance rather than user outcomes.

**Collaboration vs. individual achievement**

* **Formal message**: "Work across organizational boundaries to solve complex problems."  
* **Informal reality**: Recognition and advancement reward individual accomplishments within organizational silos.  
* **Behavioral result**: People avoid collaboration that might dilute their credit.

**User focus vs. stakeholder management**

* **Formal message**: "Put users first in all decisions."  
* **Informal reality**: Career advancement depends on managing internal stakeholders, not user satisfaction. 
* **Behavioral result**: Decisions prioritize internal politics over user needs.

## Executive Strategies for Incentive Alignment

**Audit your current incentive systems**

Conduct a systematic review of what your organization rewards:

* What behaviors led to the last five promotions in your organization?  
* What projects get the most resources and executive attention?  
* What failures result in career consequences vs. learning opportunities?  
* Who gets invited to important meetings and decision-making processes?

**Modify formal incentive systems**

**Performance evaluation changes**:

* Include user outcome metrics in all performance reviews.  
* Reward intelligent risk-taking and learning from failures. 
* Measure collaboration effectiveness, not just individual achievement.  
* Track innovation attempts and adaptation speed.

**Budget and resource allocation**:

* Fund pilot projects and experimentation explicitly.  
* Allocate resources to teams that demonstrate user-centered approaches.  
* Invest in capability building, not just project delivery.  
* Create innovation funds that reward creative problem-solving.

**Recognition and advancement**:

* Promote people who successfully lead through uncertainty and change.  
* Recognize teams that improve user outcomes, even if they use non-traditional approaches.  
* Celebrate learning from intelligent failures alongside traditional successes.  
* Create leadership advancement paths for people who drive organizational change.

## Address Informal Incentive Systems

**Model risk-taking behavior**:

* Publicly try new approaches and acknowledge when they don't work perfectly.  
* Share your learning from failures and course corrections.  
* Protect teams who take intelligent risks, even when they fail.  
* Ask about lessons learned rather than assigning blame when projects face challenges.

**Change the conversation**:

* Ask about user impact and learning in every meeting.  
* Celebrate adaptation and course correction as evidence of good management.  
* Focus on outcome achievement rather than process compliance.  
* Recognize collaboration and cross-functional problem-solving.

**Create psychological safety**:

* Establish clear boundaries between failure due to poor judgment vs. intelligent experimentation.  
* Provide resources and support for teams trying new approaches.  
* Share stories of successful innovation that came from initial failures.  
* Create forums for sharing lessons learned without attribution or blame.

## Measuring Incentive System Effectiveness

**Leading indicators** (Early warning signs):

* Frequency of intelligent risk-taking and experimentation  
* Speed of adaptation to user feedback and changing requirements  
* Cross-functional collaboration levels and effectiveness  
* Innovation proposals and creative problem-solving attempts

**Lagging indicators** (Long-term outcomes):

* User satisfaction and outcome achievement  
* Staff retention and engagement, especially among high performers  
* Speed of decision-making and implementation  
* Organizational reputation for innovation and effectiveness

**Behavioral indicators** (Day-to-day evidence):

* Questions asked in meetings (process vs. outcome focused)  
* Stories shared about success (compliance vs. impact-focused)  
* Response to problems (blame vs. learning focused)  
* Resource allocation decisions (safe vs. innovative focused)
