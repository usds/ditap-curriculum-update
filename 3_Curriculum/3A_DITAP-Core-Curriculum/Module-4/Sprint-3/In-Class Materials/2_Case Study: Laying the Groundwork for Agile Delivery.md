## I. Overview & Objectives

In this session, learners explore how to manage digital service delivery after contract award using agile approaches and performance metrics. This session builds on the solicitation strategies developed in Module 3 and extends the application of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study by shifting the focus to delivery and oversight. It reinforces the importance of continuous involvement and shared accountability—key themes throughout the DITAP course.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Define early performance metrics and indicators of agile delivery health  
* Develop a shared Sprint 0 plan and identify key post-award rhythms  
* Explore CO/COR/PO alignment and agile contracting governance  
* Apply course concepts to practical delivery and kickoff scenarios

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to deepen application of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case. It is *not part of the original case study* but builds on Milestone 1 to help learners connect stakeholder insights to early market research planning and discovery strategy. |

## II. Materials & Preparation

**Required Pre-Read for Participants:**
* Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study (Final section focused on Casey’s post-award challenges)  
* Digital Service Delivery Project Charter \+ Contract Kickoff resources

**Facilitator Notes for Students**
* Casey, Alex, and Riley's stakeholder dynamics should shape the agile delivery management approach.  
* Technical solution decisions (Custom APIs vs. Legacy Upgrades) should inform Sprint 0 planning and delivery metrics.  
* Security compliance requirements should integrate with agile delivery planning and oversight.  
* Market research insights should inform vendor relationship management and performance expectations.

## III. Session Agenda & Activities

**Activity:** Laying the Groundwork for Agile Delivery  
**Time:** 45–60 minutes  
**Purpose:** To prepare learners to design a Sprint 0 plan and align key roles and rhythms post-award.

**Instructions:**

- **CRM Delivery Planning Brainstorm (10–15 min)**
    * Prompt: *“Imagine this contract is awarded. What metrics would you want in place to track CRM delivery success?”*  
    * Facilitate a group discussion to surface risks, indicators of delivery health, and early warning signs.
- **Team Sprint 0 Planning (20–30 min)**
    * In small groups, learners design a Sprint 0 plan for the CRM solution selected in Milestone 3\.  
    * Ask: “What assumptions did we make in Milestone 3 that are now causing friction? What would we want to know or clarify before award that we didn’t specify in our requirements or evaluation?”  
    * Plans should include onboarding steps, team roles (CO/COR/PO), key agile ceremonies, collaboration rhythms, and early backlog refinement.  
    * Invite each group to share 1 success metric and 1 delivery risk.
- **Reflection (10–15 min)**
    * Prompt: *“On a scale from 0–5, how confident do you feel in managing post-award delivery? What influenced your score?”*  
      * Invite discussion starting with lower scores to identify perceived barriers, then higher scores to crowdsource ideas.  
    * Follow-up Prompts:   
      * *“How has your perspective on post-award delivery changed since the start of the course?”*  
      * *“If you inherited this contract from your past selves—based on your earlier requirements and decisions—what would frustrate you? What would you wish had been planned differently?”*

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Drafted Sprint 0 plans  
* Shared delivery risks and success metrics  
* Greater confidence in agile delivery planning

**Tips for Facilitators:**
* Connect back to decisions in Milestone 3\. How do the integration and security paths affect Sprint 0 planning?  
* Use Casey’s post-award challenges as discussion prompts. Ask: *“Who owns what in delivery?”*  
* Emphasize agile delivery as iterative and adaptive—not locked in from day one.  
* Reference the “Agile Round Robin” activity if roles need clarification.  
* Seed discussion with questions like:  
  * *“What risks does Casey face if delivery metrics aren’t defined early?”*  
  * *“How do communication rhythms and roles support transparency?”*  
  * *“What early decisions could strengthen vendor collaboration?”*

## IV. Next Steps / Follow-Up

* Ensure learners understand Milestones 4 & 5 in the case study.  
* Encourage note-taking that supports the final analysis and presentation in Module 6\.  
* Suggest learners begin collecting 1–2 takeaways from each module to integrate into their capstone.
