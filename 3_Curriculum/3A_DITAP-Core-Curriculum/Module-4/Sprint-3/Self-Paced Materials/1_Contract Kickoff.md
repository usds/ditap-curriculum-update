# Contract Kickoff: Launching Successful Digital Service Delivery
**Module 4 Sprint 3**

> _Average completion time: 45 - 60 minutes_

## Overview

You've awarded the contract, assembled the team, and defined success criteria. Now, shift your focus to post-award administration and the contract kickoff. Even when detailed discussions occur during the solicitation process, you must share and align critical information between government and vendor teams before work can begin effectively.

Kickoff meetings prove especially important in digital service procurements. They establish productive working relationships, clarify expectations, surface and address assumptions, and formally initiate the delivery process. This module examines the digital service-specific dynamics that influence the initial stages of a project and offers practical frameworks for a successful contract launch.

## Why early months feel different

Agile delivery doesn't reach peak velocity immediately. The baselining period, during which teams define their rhythm, adapt to the environment, establish a shared understanding, and iterate toward efficient delivery, typically spans 3-6 months. Industry research shows that the best Scrum teams average 750% productivity gains over waterfall teams with higher customer satisfaction and better quality delivery, but these results require intentional team development.

Contributing Factors:

* Team Dynamics: Vendor teams enter new contexts with different Product Owners, agency processes, tools, and stakeholders, requiring adjustment time.  
* Velocity Calibration: Teams use estimation techniques like story points to forecast delivery, but initial estimates gain accuracy only after several sprints build shared understanding.  
* Environment Integration: Teams familiarize themselves with agency-specific workflows, internal rules, stakeholder coordination, and approval processes.

--- 

## Establishing productive baseline metrics

**Velocity Tracking:** Calculate team velocity (in story points per sprint) after the first sprint and use the trends to forecast future delivery capacity.

**Quality Measurement:** Set initial expectations for acceptable work quality during early sprints, with clear plans to elevate standards as teams mature.

**Performance Documentation:** CORs and Product Owners should track sprint-level observations, noting patterns like repeated delays, unclear requirements, missed Definition of Done criteria, or skills gaps that indicate systemic issues requiring adjustment.

**Risk Signals Requiring Action**

* Consistent failure to improve between iterations due to identical blockers  
* Team roles or skill sets are not functioning as intended  
* Deviations from contractual procedures or misunderstandings about contract scope  
* Declining quality metrics or increasing technical debt without remediation plans

Address these signals promptly by referring to contract scope definitions, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done requirements, and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan provisions to clarify expectations and guide corrective actions.

## Strategic Sprint 0 management

**What Sprint 0 Accomplishes**

Sprint 0 represents a preparatory period before formal delivery sprints begin. Rather than a traditional sprint with a full backlog and deliverables, it functions as a setup phase, laying the foundation for productive, iterative work. In federal digital service contracts, Sprint 0 proves especially critical for navigating logistical and administrative tasks that must be completed before teams begin full delivery.

### Essential Sprint 0 activities

**Administrative Setup:**

* Onboard vendor team members (clearances, accounts, credentials)  
* Configure Government-Furnished Equipment, system access, and collaboration tools  
* Establish shared working environments (ticketing systems, version control, communication platforms)

**Project Foundation:**

* Conduct comprehensive kickoff meetings and contract orientation. 
* Define initial product vision and delivery roadmap.
* Plan and schedule Agile ceremonies and team rhythms.  
* Align on the Definition of Done, backlog structure, and performance documentation standards.

**Discovery and Planning:**

* Run discovery or design sprints to inform backlog creation.
* Conduct stakeholder interviews and technical environment assessment.  
* Validate assumptions about user needs, technical constraints, and integration requirements.

---

### Minimizing Sprint 0 duration and maximizing value

**Pre-Planning Strategies:**

1. **Build Realistic Onboarding Assumptions**: Include accurate timelines for clearances, credentials, and GFE delivery in performance schedules.
2. **Identify Parallel Pre-Access Work:** Determine tasks that contractors can complete without full access, such as research, documentation review under NDAs, design concepts, or setting up a development environment in the contractor's space.  
3. **Negotiate Shadow Access Arrangements:** Allow vendor staff to observe government team meetings or tool demonstrations while awaiting full access approvals.  
4. **Start with Discovery Sprints:** If delivery faces delays, begin with research sprints to clarify user needs, stakeholder landscape, and technical constraints, which will inform backlog creation.  
5. **Leverage Contractor-Hosted Environments**: Allow vendors to build in secure contractor environments with transition plans to government-approved infrastructure once approvals are complete.

Sprint 0 establishes a foundation for Agile success by ensuring that the right people, tools, access, and expectations are aligned before productive work begins. Strategic planning and parallel activities prevent frustration while positioning teams for faster, smoother delivery starts.

## Dual kickoff framework: Contractual and technical

### The contract kickoff

The contract kickoff focuses on the business and contractual framework governing the project. The Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Representative typically co-lead this session, with vendor teams providing solution overviews, and all parties reviewing the shared responsibilities and success criteria.

**Contract Kickoff Topics:**

* Scope of the awarded contract and performance constraints  
* Proposed methods and processes that the contractor will implement  
* Staffing approach, key personnel, and onboarding timelines  
* Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan expectations and measurement approaches  
* Contract success metrics, reporting rhythms, and performance review processes  
* Escalation procedures and performance management structures  
* Invoicing procedures, funding checkpoints, and payment schedules  
* Outstanding assumptions and clarifications not addressed during solicitation

**Contract Kickoff Outcomes:** Establish a shared understanding of the formal obligations, timelines, and administrative expectations outlined in the awarded contract, ensuring all parties understand the success criteria and accountability frameworks.


### The technical kickoff

The technical kickoff shifts focus from contract mechanics to day-to-day execution of Agile delivery. The Product Owner and the vendor's Technical Lead/Scrum Master typically co-lead this session with COR support and participation from the entire vendor delivery team.

**Technical Kickoff Topics:**

* Agreement on the Definition of Done for user stories and acceptance criteria  
* Sprint schedule and cadence (planning, demos, retrospectives, stakeholder reviews)  
* Iteration tracking tools and workflows (Jira, GitHub Projects, Azure DevOps)  
* Product backlog structure, prioritization approach, and roadmap development  
* Team roles, communication protocols, and decision-making authority  
* Development metrics tracking during iterations (velocity, throughput, quality measures)  
* Integration requirements with existing government systems and data sources  
* Security, compliance, and authorization procedures affecting development work

Technical Kickoff Outcomes: Align teams on collaborative software delivery approaches, work acceptance procedures, and sprint-by-sprint progress measurement, creating an operational foundation for productive iterations.

**Shared Success Elements**

Both kickoff meetings require:

* Everyday Language: Establish shared terminology across government and vendor teams  
* Clear Roles: Define decision-making authority and escalation pathways for different issue types  
* Communication Norms: Set expectations for regular check-ins, asynchronous updates, and stakeholder engagement  
* Performance Frameworks: Create transparent mechanisms for tracking progress and addressing performance issues collaboratively

--- 

### Key takeaways

1. Invest in Foundation Setting: Effective kickoff processes and Sprint 0 planning prevent downstream delivery issues and relationship problems while accelerating productive work.  
2. Separate Business and Technical Concerns: Distinct contractual and technical kickoff meetings ensure appropriate stakeholder engagement and role clarity for complex digital service delivery.  
3. Embrace Modern Cloud Oversight: FedRAMP 20x changes necessitate updated contract administration approaches that emphasize agency responsibility and automated validation, rather than centralized oversight.  
4. Plan for Learning Curves: Expect and plan for 3-6 month baselining periods where teams establish effective working relationships and delivery rhythms before achieving peak performance.  
5. Create Collaborative Performance Culture: Structure performance monitoring to encourage shared problem-solving and continuous improvement rather than adversarial vendor management.
