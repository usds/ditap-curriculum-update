# Managing Digital Service Delivery
**Module 4 Sprint 1**

> _Average completion time: 60 - 75 minutes_

We awarded the contract. Now what?

In many traditional acquisitions, the role of the Contracting Officer (CO) winds down significantly after award. But when it comes to digital service procurements, especially those that use Agile delivery methods, award is just the beginning. Your engagement in the post-award phase can significantly impact the success of product development.

In this module, we’ll explore how Contracting Officers can play an active, valuable role during the delivery phase of a digital service contract. You’ll learn how to work effectively with the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) and the Product Owner (PO), understand what product management means in this context, and recognize how Agile delivery teams operate once the work begins.

Your continued involvement matters. Agile product delivery thrives when all parts of the acquisition team remain connected throughout the contract. As the CO, you’re uniquely positioned to be the team’s “barrier remover,” helping identify and resolve issues early, manage contractual risks, and make sure the contract flexes with the needs of the project—all while staying compliant and goal-oriented.

This sprint will help you recognize:

* What product ownership looks like in federal digital service delivery
* How CORs and POs interact and support Agile delivery
* Why communication rhythms, shared understanding, and rituals matter
* How to help your team celebrate progress and spot success


## Digital service delivery in today's federal environment

Federal agencies are increasingly adopting digital-first approaches to improve public services. This shift is supported by evolving agency priorities and cross-government efforts to modernize public-facing services. This transformation emphasizes modern service delivery practices that prioritize user needs, support rapid iteration, and focus on measurable user outcomes rather than rigid technical requirements.

You operate in an environment where there is growing demand for faster delivery, better user experiences, and increased transparency. However, traditional procurement methods often create barriers to achieving these outcomes. Agile digital service contracts help remove these obstacles by emphasizing collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

## Building products, not just deliverables

**Understanding Product-Centered Procurement**

Digital service contracts focus on outcomes, not outputs. Instead of buying a predetermined solution, you're investing in a team's ability to solve user problems and meet mission needs.

**Traditional approach**: "Build us a system with these 47 requirements by this date." 

**Product approach:** "Help our users accomplish \[specific goal\] more effectively."

Product teams utilize research, testing, and data to inform their decisions. They build features incrementally, test them with real users, and adjust based on feedback. This approach reduces risk because you see working software frequently and can make course corrections quickly.

Your role supports this by ensuring contracts provide flexibility for discovery and iteration while maintaining appropriate oversight and accountability.

## Laying the groundwork for success

The first few times you manage a digital service delivery, it may feel unfamiliar. That’s okay. It’s not about getting everything perfect upfront, it’s about building shared understanding and accountability.

Start by getting clear on roles and expectations:

* What does the Product Owner need to make good decisions?  
* What information does the COR need to document performance?  
* What’s your role when roadblocks appear or contractual questions arise?

Before the contractor team even kicks off, consider establishing a project charter or communication plan that outlines how you’ll work together. These can be lightweight but powerful tools that define:

* What success looks like 
* How progress gets tracked 
* Who owns decisions at different stages 
* How and when to escalate concerns 
* How you’ll celebrate wins—and how you’ll course-correct if needed

Remember: this stage is about delivery, but it’s also about learning, improving, and staying connected to the people and goals you’re serving. Agile contracts have shown up to three times higher success rates than traditional waterfall efforts—because of this continuous involvement, shared accountability, and focus on delivering real, working results.

See the attached Sample Project Charter for a template to kick off this process: 
[Project Charter](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/d0e92385bb4b3d14be7b45ffe14cafc73c5c125a/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-4/Module-4-Media/Digital_Service_Project_Charter.md)


## Agile framework in federal procurement 

**How Agile Events Align with Oversight Roles and Responsibilities**

Federal Agile delivery often follows a consistent two-week sprint cadence. While teams may vary in complexity, size, or contract structure, this foundational rhythm offers clarity for performance oversight, vendor accountability, and stakeholder communication.

This guide outlines how standard Agile ceremonies align with the responsibilities of the **Product Owner (PO)**, **Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)**, and **Contracting Officer (CO)**

### Agile ceremony overview \+ procurement touchpoints

#### Daily standup (daily, 15 minutes)

* **What Happens**: Vendor team shares status updates, blockers, and next steps.  
* **PO Role**: Ensures focus remains on outcomes and product priorities.  
* **COR Role** *(Optional)*: May attend to observe team health or identify early risk signals.  
* **Procurement Alignment**:
  
  * COR notes major blockers or risks that may impact delivery.  
  * Can inform discussions with CO if risks persist or escalate.

#### Sprint planning (start of every sprint – e.g., Week 1, Week 3)

* **What Happens**: Vendor team commits to a set of prioritized stories from the product backlog.
* **PO Role**: Finalizes backlog priorities aligned to user needs and contract scope.
* **COR Role**: Observes and documents sprint goals, noting dependencies or delivery risks.
* **Procurement Alignment**:
  
  - COR ensures planned work aligns with contract objectives and performance standards.
  - Documents expectations for QASP tracking and vendor evaluation.


#### Sprint review (end of each sprint – e.g., Week 2, Week 4)

* **What Happens**: Vendor demos completed work to PO, COR, and stakeholders.  
* **PO Role**: Accepts or rejects deliverables based on the agreed Definition of Done (DoD).  
* **COR Role**: Evaluates whether outputs meet expectations for quality, timeliness, and user value.  
* **Procurement Alignment**:
  
  * COR documents observations in the performance file.  
  * Key input to QASP, CPARS, and other performance assessments.

#### Sprint retrospective (end of each sprint)

* **What Happens**: Internal team (vendor and government) reflects on what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.
* **PO Role**: Fosters a learning culture, encouraging feedback and continuous improvement.
* **COR Role**: Participates in discussions that may surface delivery risks or suggest contract adjustments.
* **Procurement Alignment**:
  
  - Lessons learned may prompt updates to backlog, team processes, or performance plans.


#### Monthly business review (end of month)

* **What Happens**: PO, COR, and CO review sprint outcomes, address contract questions, and plan forward.  
* **Who Participates**: CO, COR, PO, vendor lead  
* **Procurement Alignment**:
  
  * Formal checkpoint to assess vendor performance.  
  * Address contractual matters: funding, risk, modifications, scope shifts.  
  * Celebrate progress, align on upcoming priorities, and track delivery against milestones.

## Why this matters for procurement

This Agile rhythm allows the government to:

* Tie the vendor’s work directly to observable, time-bound outcomes.  
* Provide continuous oversight without micromanagement.  
* Identify delivery issues early—before they become contract problems.  
* Maintain a clear, documented audit trail for performance and risk.

## Summary of alignment points

| Activity | Agile Purpose | Procurement Alignment |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Pre-sprint sizing & backlog refinement** | Estimate effort and prioritize work for upcoming sprint | COR observes scope and complexity to help frame evaluation criteria; informs performance expectations |
| **User story definition** | Describe user need from their perspective using clear, testable format | PO defines stories with users and stakeholders; COR ensures alignment to contract goals and measurable outcomes |
| **Definition of done (DoD)** | Establish shared understanding of what "done" means for any deliverable | PO clarifies quality and completion criteria; COR uses DoD to validate deliverables and inform QASP tracking |
| **Sprint planning** | Team commits to prioritized work from backlog for next 2-week sprint | PO confirms priority and scope; COR observes planning and records sprint goals for tracking |
| **Daily standup** | Share progress and identify blockers | COR may attend to monitor team health or escalating risks; optional observation for early issue detection |
| **Sprint review** | Demo working software and gather stakeholder feedback | PO accepts or rejects deliverables per Definition of Done; COR assesses delivery quality and timeliness |
| **Sprint retrospective** | Reflect on process and identify improvements | COR and PO note performance trends or risk patterns that may affect delivery or contract terms |
| **Monthly demo** | Show value delivered across sprints; gather broader feedback | Stakeholder and COR input informs vendor evaluation; success metrics linked to QASP and performance file |
| **Monthly business review** | Discuss outcomes, risks, and acquisition implications | CO, COR, and PO align on contract needs; adjust scope, funding, or terms as needed |


## Managing risks in Agile digital service contracts

Agile contracts necessitate distinct risk management approaches compared to traditional acquisitions. Instead of trying to define everything upfront, you manage risks through transparency and frequent checkpoints.

* **Technical Risks**: Regular demos reveal technical problems early when they're easier to fix.
* **Scope Risks**: Product owners continuously prioritize features, ensuring the most valuable work gets completed first.
* **Performance Risks**: Short sprints provide frequent opportunities to assess contractor performance and make adjustments.
* **Budget Risks**: Time-and-materials contracts with labor hour caps provide flexibility while controlling costs.
* **Schedule Risks**: Delivering working software every sprint ensures you always have something valuable, even if the scope changes.

Your job isn't to eliminate these risks but to create contracts that help teams manage them effectively.

## FAR compliance in Agile risk management

Updated FAR requirements provide new frameworks for managing risks in Agile digital service contracts:

**FAR Part 39 risk management updates**:
- Requirements for continuous risk assessment aligned with Agile delivery cycles
- New escalation procedures that account for iterative development timelines
- Integration of cybersecurity risk management with Agile delivery practices

**FAR Part 6 competition risk considerations**:
- Managing compteition risks in multi-phase Agile procurements
- Requirements for maintaining competitive integrity throughout iterative delivery
- Risk mitigation strategies for vendor transitions in continuous competition models

**Digital Collaboration in Remote and Hybrid Work**

Modern digital service teams often work remotely or in hybrid arrangements. This arrangement requires different collaboration approaches than traditional on-site work.

* **Digital Workspaces:** Teams use shared platforms like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or similar tools for daily communication. CORs should have access to relevant channels for transparency.
* **Documentation:** Teams maintain shared documentation on platforms such as Confluence, Notion, or GitHub. Ensure CORs can access sprint reports, retrospective notes, and decision records.
* **Virtual Ceremonies**: Sprint reviews and retrospectives happen via video conference. These provide excellent opportunities for oversight without disrupting team flow.
* **Asynchronous Communication:** Teams document decisions and progress continuously rather than waiting for formal meetings. This process creates more effective audit trails and greater transparency.

Ensure your contracts account for these modern work patterns while maintaining appropriate oversight.

## Measuring success in digital service delivery

Traditional contracts measure success based on the completion of deliverables and compliance. Digital service contracts measure success based on user outcomes and the impact on the mission.

**User-Centered Metrics:**

* User satisfaction scores  
* Task completion rates  
* Time to complete common tasks  
* Accessibility compliance

**Business Metrics:**

* Cost savings from improved processes  
* Reduction in support tickets  
* Increased digital adoption rates  
* Mission goal achievement

**Delivery Metrics:**

* Sprint goal completion rates  
* Velocity trends over time  
* Code quality indicators  
* Security compliance

**Team Health Metrics:**

* Sprint retrospective feedback  
* Team communication effectiveness  
* Blocker resolution time  
* Stakeholder satisfaction

Work with your COR and PO to establish baseline measurements and track improvements over time.
