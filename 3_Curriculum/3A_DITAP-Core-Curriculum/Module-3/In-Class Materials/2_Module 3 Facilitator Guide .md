## Overview & objectives
    

### Module summary 

With Module 3, participants will learn to build a well-structured solicitation. They’ll create strategic decisions around tradeoffs, evaluation processes, contract structure, and performance metrics which lead to the development of requirements, solicitation factors, and evaluation criteria that support user-centered outcomes and successful vendor partnerships.

In sprint one, participants gain expertise in effective acquisition strategy, getting to know methods for planning, the resources, associated risks, and exit strategies, should they be necessary. They will be equipped with the tools to know that what they are buying matches the needs of their agency. They also will be able to discern what a successful procurement looks like by establishing appropriate metrics.

They will discuss the use of market research, including various options for promoting an RFI, building an Agile marketplace, testing an acquisition hypothesis, and using the Sources Sought tool.

Next in the sequence are detailed descriptions of how to use metrics and incentives in service of administering and awarding digital services contracts. Tools will be reviewed, and teams will be able to practice building incentives to draw in contractors. 

In Sprint 2, learners will get the specifics for how to develop a solicitation, with hands-on activities that make the experience more concrete. They will also grow to understand how to shift to an outcomes-based acquisition model.

Sprint 3 provides hands-on experience with a case study exercise in designing a solicitation strategy. They will learn the important elements of running a successful evaluation process with Agile and modern evaluation methods. 

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Explain the purpose and value of acquisition strategy planning in the federal procurement lifecycle  
* Identify how acquisition strategies vary depending on inherited contracts versus new procurements  
* Apply key pre-award activities—such as stakeholder engagement and market research—to inform strategic decisions  
* Describe the lean canvas approach and its role as a living document in agile acquisition environments  
* Recognize when and how to update the acquisition strategy based on new inputs and evolving conditions

### Connection to overall DITAP program 

This module supports the DITAP competency of applying effective techniques for acquiring digital service solutions in a solicitation and acquisition strategy, focusing on understanding the market and developing a clear statement of objectives that shifts focus to outcomes-based acquisition. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.  

This module focuses on understanding the market and developing a clear statement of objectives that emphasizes outcomes-based acquisition. It supports the DITAP competency of applying effective techniques for acquiring digital service solutions within solicitation and acquisition strategies. This approach reinforces the DITAP program's broader goal of shifting from traditional, process-heavy procurement to a more adaptive, outcome-driven method that facilitates digital service delivery.  

This session builds on prior learning from Module 2, and prepares learners for upcoming topics such digital service delivery management and assessment. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing the Lean Canvas as a strategic planning tool and evaluating the ethical and legal impacts of artificial intelligence at their agency.

### Facilitator themes / notes

| Theme to Look For | Facilitator Notes / Key Points |
| :---- | :---------------------------- |
| Government access & ownership of data | Who owns the data, and how can the government access and use it? |
| Licensing & intellectual property (IP) risks | Are the licensing terms overly restrictive or ambiguous? |
| Proprietary encryption or technology lock-in | Is the vendor using technology that prevents interoperability or creates dependency? |
| Data security & compliance obligations | Does the vendor’s approach meet federal data security standards? |
| Legal & contractual clarity | Is legal involved early enough? Are terms clearly defined? |
| Roles & stakeholders | Who else should be involved in risk mitigation? |

---

### Bonus: Stretch thinking

Facilitator can encourage learners to go beyond compliance and think strategically:  
- How can we future-proof this acquisition?  
- Should we include data portability or exit strategy clauses?  
- Can we negotiate rights to use the platform IP in other government contexts?

| # | Expected Participant Responses                       | Listen For                                                                                                                              | Facilitator Insight                                                                                                                                              |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Overly complex task order requirements**           | - "The RFP was too long/technical/dense."<br>- "The instructions were unclear or burdensome."                                         | Complex formats, unclear instructions, or outdated templates can intimidate or exhaust smaller vendors. Look for awareness of readability and formatting issues. |
| 2 | **Misalignment with vendor capabilities**            | - "The scope didn't match vendor strengths."<br>- "We required past performance in a narrow niche."                                     | Requirements may unintentionally favor incumbents. Encourage thinking about how to structure work to attract a wider range of qualified vendors.                 |
| 3 | **Unrealistic timelines**                            | - "The response window was too short."<br>- "We dropped the task order around a holiday or at fiscal year-end."                         | Compressed timelines can exclude smaller vendors without dedicated proposal teams.                                                                               |
| 4 | **Lack of market awareness or engagement**           | - "We didn’t host a Q&A session or industry day."<br>- "There was no prior market research or vendor engagement."                        | Agencies must actively signal upcoming opportunities and cultivate interest. Forecasting helps vendors plan and prepare.                                         |
| 5 | **Overly restrictive or biased evaluation criteria** | - "The criteria required very specific past government experience."<br>- "There were hidden preferences for an incumbent solution."     | Encourage participants to reframe evaluation criteria around capability and potential, not just history.                                                         |
| 6 | **Lack of transparency or trust in the process**     | - "Some vendors felt the same vendors always win."<br>- "We never share debriefs or redacted winning proposals."                        | Transparency builds trust. Silence or opacity discourages future participation.                                                                                   |
                                                                      


**Facilitator Tips for Probing Further**

* Ask: “How might a small or non-traditional vendor interpret this solicitation?”  
* Ask: “If only 2 out of 8 vendors bid, what might that signal about equity?”  
* Prompt teams to think: “How would you adjust your next task order to fix this?”

13. ### Activity: Use a trade-off matrix to help determine what matters most

    Total Time Allocation: 15 min 

    #### Activity instructions:

* **Purpose:** To practice using the trade-off matrices to help clarify priorities  
* **Expected Outcomes**: Learners will be able to develop rationales for using either of the matrices and use that knowledge to apply a matrix to their capstone project.   
* **Materials Needed:**   
  * Breakout rooms or digital equivalent  
* **Instructions:**  
  * **Each group chooses a matrix**  
    * A member of each group will report out the reasons for choosing the matrix.  
    * Groups will apply the matrix to make tradeoffs for their capstone project.  
    * Learners should think about what worked: what’s on each of the axes?  
  * **Come back and discuss**: “How was the dialogue? This is important.”  
    * “Let’s go from one Capstone group to another.”  
    * “When we wrap, hope you got a sense, if you haven’t yet, people take positions, positions get personalized. Natural emotion, but not always the right emotion. Some folks will feel more strongly about other features, etc.”

| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Emphasize the *tone* of debriefings: it’s not just compliance — it’s an opportunity to strengthen the acquisition ecosystem.                                             |
| Tie the discussion back to templates included in Module 3 Sprint 3 self-paced learning (e.g., include a “Vendor Feedback” moment in their own draft debriefing agendas). |
| If time allows, have learners write a short “Closing Statement” they would use in a real debriefing and get peer feedback.                                               |
