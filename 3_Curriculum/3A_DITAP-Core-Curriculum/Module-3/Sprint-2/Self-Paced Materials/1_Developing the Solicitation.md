# Strategic Planning and Execution in Digital Acquisitions
**Module 3 Sprint 2**

> _Average completion time: 60 - 90 minutes_

In today’s rapidly evolving federal procurement environment, agencies must adopt more agile, outcome-driven approaches to meet the complex needs of their missions. Traditional acquisition methods, anchored in prescriptive requirements, fixed personnel, and lengthy timelines, often fail to deliver timely and adaptable solutions, especially in digital service contexts.

## Revolutionary FAR Overhaul context

The Revolutionary Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Overhaul, issued through Executive Order 14275 in April 2025, has fundamentally transformed the regulatory landscape for digital acquisitions. FAR Part 6 has been substantially streamlined from five subparts to three, reducing the number of sections from over 30 to under 20.

FAR Part 39 has been redesigned to emphasize modular contracting as a core mechanic, with deliverables expected within tight timeframes often under 18 months from solicitation issuance.

These changes directly impact this unit's focus areas:
- **Strategic planning**: Must now account for modular contracting approaches and 180-day award timelines 
- **Flexible documentation**: SOOs must align with performance-based ICT requirements
- **Collaborative execution**: Teams must adapt to accelerated procurement cycles
- **Modern decision-support**: AI tools become more critical for managing rapid, iterative acquisitions

This sprint prepares learners to navigate and lead digital acquisitions by focusing on strategic planning, flexible documentation, collaborative execution, and modern decision-support tools. The learning journey begins with a case-based exploration of tradeoffs and mission alignment, then moves into crafting outcome-oriented Statements of Objectives (SOOs) and rethinking staffing through the lens of Agile. Learners will also explore how **artificial intelligence (AI)** is reshaping the acquisition landscape, supporting faster analysis, enhancing decision-making, and aligning procurement with agency maturity models. The unit concludes by equipping participants with practical strategies for negotiating with vendors in a manner that fosters trust, clarity, and optimal value outcomes.

By weaving together foundational practices with forward-leaning technologies, this unit empowers acquisition professionals to lead with both strategy and innovation.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this sprint, participants will be able to navigate the post-Revolutionary FAR Overhaul acquisition environment, applying streamlined competition requirements and modular contracting principles to:

1. **Analyze tradeoffs and mission priorities** using structured case study methods to inform acquisition strategy decisions.
2. **Develop a Statement of Objectives (SOO)** that articulates clear, outcome-based needs aligned with user and agency goals.
3. **Differentiate between key personnel requirements and outcome-based contracting**, and apply Agile-compatible strategies to team evaluation.
4. **Evaluate the strategic role of AI** in acquisition planning, risk mitigation, and digital services maturity within the framework of the Revolutionary FAR Overhaul requirements for modular contracting and accelerated ICT procurement.
5. **Plan and conduct effective vendor negotiations** that clarify assumptions, resolve misunderstandings, and support best-value outcomes in digital procurements.
6. **Apply Revolutionary FAR Overhaul principles** to digital acquisitions, including modular contracting requirements under revised FAR Part 39 and streamlined competition procedures under FAR Part 6.

## Understanding FAR 37.6: How does agile methodology fit into federal acquisitions?

While **FAR 37.6** does not specifically mention Agile methodologies, it aligns with the principles and practices that underpin Agile development approaches. Here’s how FAR 37.6 can be linked to Agile software development:

1\. **Outcome-Focused Approach:** FAR 37.6 emphasizes the importance of focusing on outcomes rather than prescribing specific methods or processes. Similarly, Agile software development emphasizes delivering value and achieving desired outcomes through iterative development and frequent feedback loops.

2\. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility and adaptability in responding to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback. FAR 37.6 encourages agencies to structure contracts that provide flexibility and allow for adjustments based on evolving needs, aligning with Agile’s adaptive approach.

3\. **Collaboration and Communication:** Agile development emphasizes frequent collaboration and communication among stakeholders, including government agencies and contractors. FAR 37.6 promotes early engagement and collaboration between the government and industry partners to ensure a shared understanding of requirements and foster effective communication throughout the procurement process.

4\. **Iterative Delivery and Continuous Improvement:** Agile software development promotes iterative delivery, allowing for the early release of functional software components. FAR 37.6 supports the concept of progressive acquisition, where contracts are structured to enable incremental deliveries and continuous improvement, aligning with the iterative nature of Agile development.

By leveraging the flexibility, collaboration, iterative delivery, and outcome-focused approach of both FAR 37.6 and Agile, government agencies can foster more efficient and effective software development processes that deliver value to stakeholders.

It’s important to note that compliance with FAR 37.6 and the specific procurement regulations of government agencies is necessary when implementing Agile software development within a government context. Consulting with legal and procurement experts familiar with government regulations is recommended to ensure adherence to all applicable guidelines.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) in procurement

The use of AI in both the private and public sectors is a game-changer. AI can help teams rapidly analyze vast amounts of data, enabling them to gain valuable insights that can save significant time and resources. Businesses use AI to optimize enterprise resource systems, automate routine tasks, forecast consumer demand and behavior, and even innovate new products and services. 

Likewise, government agencies utilize AI to enhance cybersecurity, expedite data analysis, and even aid commanders in accelerating operational execution. While various uses of AI in acquisition are still being explored, there is little debate on the benefits. 

### What “AI in procurement” really means

AI in procurement goes beyond simply buying AI tools; it's about fundamentally transforming how we manage contracts, analyze data, make decisions, and create value. In government acquisition, this includes:

* **Procuring AI**: Buying AI tools and services responsibly, ensuring clear data use and risk frameworks.
* **Using AI**: Applying AI to automate workflows, enhance contract management, forecast demand, and generate insights.
* **Powering Procurement with AI**: Transforming procurement from a support function into a strategic, data-driven decision engine.

### How AI supports acquisition strategy

AI can enhance nearly every phase of acquisition strategy from planning and market research to contract writing and risk management. Here’s how:

| Function | AI's Strategic Contribution | AI Type |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Market Research | Identifies trends, vendors, and technologies | Predictive |
| Lifecycle Costing | Forecasts sustainment costs and obsolescence | Predictive |
| Contract Drafting | Drafts RFPs, PWSs, and justifications | Generative |
| Risk Identification | Flags supplier risks, anomalies, and disruption scenarios | Predictive |
| Demand Forecasting | Anticipates needs based on usage, mission, and external conditions | Predictive |
| Performance Management | Predicts vendor delays and supports corrective planning | Predictive |
| Modular Acquisition Planning | Supports incremental delivery planning and performance-based contracting aligned with FAR 39.103 | Predictive |
| Regulatory Compliance | Ensures FAR Part 39 AI requirements and Part 6 competition provisions are met | Both ||

Some tools may use a blend of predictive and generative AI, this depends on the function and the data available.

### Predictive AI

Predictive AI, also known as predictive analytics, uses machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data, identifying patterns to make predictions and spot anomalies. It can help acquisition professionals move from reactive to proactive planning.

In acquisition strategy, Predictive AI can:

* Forecast future needs to shape long-term acquisition strategies.  
* Improve framing assumptions for cost, schedule, and performance baselines.  
* Reduce manual research by identifying trends, risks, or anomalies in real time.

By rapidly analyzing historical and current data, predictive AI enables better-informed decisions, reduces manual analysis, and strengthens long-term acquisition planning.

### Generative AI

Generative AI analyzes and uses data to create new content. Its quality can be linked to the amount of data it accesses, which may be a limiting factor in acquisition due to restricted access to sensitive information. In acquisition, tools like ChatGPT or CoPilot can streamline documentation tasks.documentation.

In acquisition, Generative AI can:

* Draft strategy documents, market research summaries, or justifications  
* Suggest alternative approaches or identify missing elements  
* Save time and increase consistency in document development

While AI expands our capabilities, it doesn’t replace the need for sound judgment. Strategic planning still demands creativity, ethical awareness, and contextual understanding, none of which AI can fully replicate.

**Regulatory compliance support**

AI tools can help ensure compliance with FAR Part 39 requirements by automating documentation of AI system capabilities, tracking algorithmic performance metrics, and maintaining required bias testing records. Similarly, AI can support FAR Part 6 compliance by enhancing market research capabilities while maintaining audit trails that demonstrate fair competition practices.

### Policy and guidance: What’s new

U.S. Federal policy has rapidly evolved to support the responsible use of AI in procurement and acquisition. 

### Executive Orders

* [EO 14179 (Jan 2025\)**: *Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/) revokes EO 14110 and orders the federal government to modernize its AI acquisition and governance practices.

* [M-25-21](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-21-Accelerating-Federal-Use-of-AI-through-Innovation-Governance-and-Public-Trust.pdf) & [M-25-22](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-22-Driving-Efficient-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Government.pdf) (April 2025\): Replaces earlier guidance with updated requirements on identifying “high-impact” AI use cases, enforcing human oversight, and prioritizing open, fair, and responsible AI contracting practices. 

Revolutionary FAR Overhaul Impact on AI-Enabled Procurement

The Revolutionary FAR Overhaul has fundamentally transformed how agencies approach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) procurement through revised FAR Part 39, now retitled "Acquisition of Information and Communication Technology." The revised Part 39 anchors rules directly in statutory authority, including 41 U.S.C. § 2308 (Modular contracting for information technology) and 29 U.S.C. § 794d (Electronic and information technology), while clearing away outdated Office of Management and Budget circular references. 

Key changes affecting AI procurement include:

- **Modular Contracting as Core Requirement**: Agencies should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting to acquire major systems of information technology, with contracts structured to ensure the Government is not required to procure additional increments. 
- **Accelerated Procurement Timeline**: Modular contracts for information technology should be awarded within 180 days after solicitation issuance to avoid obsolescence.
- **Performance-Based Focus**: FAR Part 39 now requires contractors to provide evidence of success in delivering performance-based outcomes for ICT services. 
- **Enhanced Accessibility Requirements**: FAR Part 39 strengthens the mandate for accessibility compliance, requiring additional administrative effort and human capital specialists for Section 508 requirements. 

### Federal AI use case inventory

A comprehensive inventory of AI use across the federal government gives insight into how agencies are applying AI now (as of January 23, 2025):

* 2,133 total AI use cases across 41 agencies.
* 351 classified as rights- and/or safety-impacting.
* Procurement-specific uses include spend analysis, supplier risk modeling, automated evaluation, and fraud detection.

### Key considerations for procurement leaders

To effectively use AI in acquisition strategy:

1. **Use AI for strategy support, not strategy substitution**  
   Human leadership is still essential for ethics, context, and creativity.
2. **Strengthen data governance**  
   AI tools are only as good as the data they're trained on—data quality matters.
3. **Write better contracts**  
   Be explicit about IP ownership, model use, data privacy, exit rights, and bias detection.
4. **Invest in team skills**  
   Strategic thinking, analytics, and data literacy are now must-haves for procurement professionals.
5. **Shift focus from transactions to value**  
   Use AI to free up time for higher-level analysis, supplier engagement, and innovation.
6. **Comply with updated FAR requirements**
   Ensure acquisition strategies align with FAR Part 39 AI-specific requirements and Part 6 enhanced competition provisions. This includes proper AI system classification, required documentation, and appropriate competition strategies for AI procurements. 

### The way forward

Efforts are underway to examine the use of AI in developing and writing an acquisition strategy (and other key acquisition documents). We are still learning and, given the potential benefits, a coordinated effort could offer significant value. If we accept the premise that the quality of the acquisition strategy is directly linked to subsequent acquisition outcomes, continued investment in AI and its optimal use can yield significant returns on that investment.

## Discussion prompt (optional): How should AI influence acquisition strategy development?
>Note for vendors: this is an optional self-paced learning activity in the LMS. 

AI is rapidly changing the landscape of both private industry and public sector operations. From predictive analytics that forecast long-term sustainment and supply chain trends, to generative tools that draft acquisition documents or simulate operational environments, AI has clear potential to improve how we design and deliver acquisition strategies.

However, while AI can analyze massive data sets, generate content, and help identify risks and opportunities, it cannot replace the critical thinking, innovation, and contextual judgment that real-world acquisition decisions demand.

**Regulatory framework considerations**

Recent updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, particularly FAR Parts 6 and 39, establish new requirements for AI acquisitions, including system classification, algorithmic impact assessments, competition considerations, and enhanced data rights provisions. These regulatory changes create both opportunities and challenges for acquisition professionals developing AI-integrated strategies, requiring careful consideration of compliance requirements alongside strategic objectives.

**Discussion prompts**

Choose one of the following prompts and share a short reflection. Your insight may help inform how others approach the integration of AI into acquisition practices.

* What roles do you think predictive and generative AI should play in acquisition strategy development within your agency or program? (e.g., Should AI be used only for market research? Could it help frame assumptions?)  
* What risks or limitations should procurement professionals watch for when using AI in this space? (e.g., How do we handle bias, data access, or over-reliance on AI-generated content?)  
* Have you or your team used AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, other platforms) in acquisition tasks? If so, what worked well, and what didn’t?  
* Do you believe AI will enhance or challenge the role of human judgment and innovation in acquisition planning? Why? (e.g., Will AI free us to focus on strategic thinking—or risk diminishing it?)
* How should recent updates to FAR Parts 6 and 39 influence your approach to AI acquisition strategy? (e.g., How do new AI classification requirements affect your procurement planning? What impact do enhanced competition provisions have on vendor engagement strategies?)

### 7 Strategies for evaluating the ethical and legal impact of implementing AI in federal agencies

As federal agencies harness the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance their operations, addressing the ethical and legal implications associated with acquiring and deploying AI technologies naturally takes center stage.
