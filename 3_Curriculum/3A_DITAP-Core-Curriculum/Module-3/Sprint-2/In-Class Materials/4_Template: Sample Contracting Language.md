# Sample Contracting Language on Accessible Procurement and ICT

## Accessibility standards (required for all ICT deliverables)

All Information and Communication Technology (ICT) developed, acquired, or maintained under this contract shall conform to accessibility standards to ensure equitable access for individuals with disabilities.

For all new development or significant modernization efforts, ICT must meet or exceed the latest published recommendations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as issued by the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), at a minimum of Level AA conformance. This requirement ensures adherence to an evergreen standard that evolves with best practices in digital accessibility.

For existing legacy systems undergoing minor modifications, maintenance or with explicit permission of the contractor, adherence to the applicable provisions of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. § 794d), as amended, and its implementing regulations, including the Revised 508 Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), is required. Any new components integrated into legacy systems must still strive for conformance with the latest WAI WCAG recommendations where feasible.

## Procurement of accessible ICT

The Contractor shall, in all procurement activities related to this contract, prioritize and ensure the acquisition of accessible ICT solutions. This includes, but is not limited to, hardware, software, electronic content, support documentation, and services that directly impact accessibility.

Procurement processes must:

* Integrate clear and measurable accessibility requirements directly into all solicitation documents, statements of work, and performance specifications.  
* Require prospective vendors to thoroughly describe their organizational capabilities, policies, and processes for designing, developing, and delivering accessible ICT solutions, along with providing an Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) in an OpenACR format (both HTML and YAML).  
* Vendors may be asked to provide video evidence that the ICT integrates seamlessly with diverse assistive technologies and does not create barriers for individuals with disabilities.  
* Establish mechanisms for post-award verification of accessibility conformance and continuous monitoring of procured ICT throughout its lifecycle. Annual ACR submissions should be expected in project with maintenance requirements.  
* Document any exceptions or waivers to accessibility requirements, with clear justification, as per agency policy and federal regulations.

## Evaluation criteria – Accessibility and inclusive design

Proposals submitted under this contract will be evaluated on how well they:

* Demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of, and commitment to, the latest WCAG recommendations and applicable Section 508 standards.  
* Outline a detailed plan for integrating accessibility throughout the entire project lifecycle, from initial design and development to rigorous testing, secure deployment, and ongoing maintenance.  
* Provide compelling evidence of extensive experience in designing, developing, and testing accessible ICT, including direct engagement and usability testing with individuals with diverse disabilities.  
* Describe robust methodologies for continuous monitoring, proactive identification, and timely remediation of accessibility issues, including the use of both automated tools and expert manual review.  
* Detail comprehensive strategies for providing accessible user support, documentation, and training, ensuring information is available in multiple accessible formats.  
* Present internal organizational policies, staff training programs, and quality assurance processes that demonstrate a sustained commitment to digital accessibility.

## Accessibility deliverables

Required deliverables for ICT projects under this contract include:

* An Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR) for all new or significantly modified ICT, completed using the latest version of OpenACR, demonstrating conformance with the latest WAI WCAG recommendations at Level AA.  
* Detailed accessibility testing documentation, including results from automated and manual testing, and usability testing with individuals with disabilities.  
* All user-facing documentation, training materials, and support resources must be provided in accessible formats.  
* A plan for ongoing accessibility maintenance, including regular audits, monitoring tools, and remediation processes.  
* Documentation of any third-party components used and their accessibility status.  
* Where open source components are used, contributions of accessibility-related improvements (e.g., bug fixes, enhanced ARIA support, keyboard navigation, or documentation) back to the relevant upstream open source projects, where feasible and permissible. Information on this should be covered in regular reporting.

## Ongoing accessibility compliance and maintenance

The Contractor must:

* Proactively monitor newly released accessibility standards, guidelines, and best practices, adapting processes as necessary to maintain compliance with evolving requirements (e.g., future WCAG versions).  
* Establish and adhere to a process for promptly identifying, reporting, documenting, and prioritizing accessibility barriers, including regressions caused by code changes, and remediating them based on their impact.  
* Provide training to project personnel on accessibility principles, development techniques, and testing methodologies relevant to their roles.  
* Maintain clear documentation of accessibility features, known issues, and planned remediation efforts.  
* Ensure that all updates, upgrades, and changes to the ICT maintain or improve its accessibility conformance.
