# The Power of Debriefing Activity

Debriefings can significantly help shape the way vendors bid on future procurements, as well as provide an opportunity to explain why they didn’t win and what they could do better next time.  Here are several readings to help further your understanding of this process, as well as add new tools to your toolbox:

* [Proposed Debriefing Agenda](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-3/In-Class-Materials/Proposed%20Debriefing%20Agenda%20Template.md)

## Facilitation Format Options

* Small group breakout (if live)  
* Individual journaling or written reflection (if self-paced)  
* Asynchronous discussion board

**Scenario Prompt:**  You just wrapped up a post-award debriefing. The vendor was disappointed, quiet, and didn’t ask any questions. You stuck to the script — you provided all the required info, but the session felt cold and one-sided.

**Now, imagine you could “rewrite the ending” of that debriefing. What could you have said or asked to:**

* Help the vendor walk away with value?  
* Turn the conversation into a trust-building moment?  
  Encourage them to bid again?

### ILT Facilitator Notes

* Emphasize the *tone* of debriefings: it’s not just compliance — it’s an opportunity to strengthen the acquisition ecosystem.  
* Tie the discussion back to templates Module 3 Sprint 3 self-paced learning (above) (e.g., include a “Vendor Feedback” moment in their own draft debriefing agendas).  
* If time allows, have learners write a short “Closing Statement” they would use in a real debriefing and get peer feedback.

## Activity

### Introduction (10 min) 
Present the scenario verbally or on a slide. Emphasize the *relational* role of debriefs — not just compliance. 

Ask: *"Has anyone experienced a debrief like this?"*  

### Small Group (15 min) 
Divide into groups of 3–5 people. Use one slide with the three questions:

* What could you say or ask to help the vendor walk away with value?  
* What could you say to turn it into a trust-building moment?  
* How could you encourage them to bid again?

### Share-Out (15 min) 
Call on 2–3 groups to share highlights. Summarize effective phrases or techniques that emerge.
