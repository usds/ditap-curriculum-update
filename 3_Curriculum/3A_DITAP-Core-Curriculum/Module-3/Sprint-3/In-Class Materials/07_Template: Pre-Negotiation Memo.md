## Part C: Cost and Profit/Fee Analysis

In this Part C, compare, in summary, the offeror's proposal, the audit and/or other recommendations, and the Grantee's Pre-negotiation objective. For example:

| Cost Element | Offeror's Proposal | Audit/Technical Recommendation* | Pre-negotiation Objective | Numbered Notes** |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| Direct Labor | $ | $ | $ | (1) |
| Labor Overhead | $ | $ | 4 | (2) |
| Direct Material | $ | $ | $ | (3) |
| Mat'l Overhead | $ | $ | $ | (2) |
| Other Direct Costs | $ | $ | $ | (4) |
| Subtotal | $ | $ | $ | (2) |
| G&A | $ | $ | $ | (5) |
| Subtotal | $ | $ | $ | (6) |
| Profit/Fee | $ | $ | $ | |
| Total | $ | $ | $ | |

The above is an example of the various cost elements that should be reviewed when analyzing a proposal. These elements are not to be interpreted as all-encompassing because the cost elements of each offeror may be different.

**Audit/Technical Recommendedation:**
In general, an audit report will not include recommendations on direct labor hours or the validity of material and other direct costs. The technical evaluation/analysis generally will not include rate recommendations. Therefore, this column should be a combination of your two reports (audit and technical). In cases where you have not obtained an audit, you need only reflect the "Offeror's Proposal" and "Pre-negotiation Objective" columns. The technical evaluation results can be addressed in your discussions, and would normally be used in the establishment of your objective.  

For your information, "Technical Analysis" is defined as the examination and evaluation by personnel having specialized knowledge, skills, experience, or capability in engineering, science, or management of proposed quantities and kinds of materials, labor, processes, special tooling, facilities, and associated factors which have been set forth in a proposal. In order to determine and report on the need for the reasonableness of the proposed resources assuming reasonable economy and efficiency, special knowledge is required. Therefore, a technical evaluation that doesn't address individual elements of cost (i.e., labor categories, labor hours, material, other direct costs, etc.), but merely states that the proposal is acceptable, is not considered adequate.

---

**Numbered Notes:**


**(1) Direct Labor**  
Compare, in detailed discussion, the proposal, the audit and/or technical recommendations, and the pre-negotiation objective direct labor categories, hours and rates. For example:

| Labor Category | Offeror's Proposal | Audit/Technical Recommendation | Pre-negotiation Objective |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
|                | Hours | Rate | Amt | Hours | Rate | Amt | Hours | Rate | Amt |
| Engineer       | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   |
| Programmer     | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   |
| Clerical       | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   | xx    | $    | $   |
| Total          |       |      | $   |       |      | $   |       |      | $   |


**Offeror's Proposal**  
First subparagraph. Summarize the offeror's rationale for the proposed labor categories, hours and rates. Questions you can consider are: Are the proposed labor rates the result of a negotiated forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA)? Are they unaudited bidding rates which have been approved at a corporate level? Are they current actual rates for specific employees or a composite rate for personnel under each labor category? If the labor rates are developed on a specific base rate, what escalation factor (if any), has the offeror applied to the base rate? Is that a reasonable factor? Are the proposed labor categories and hours based upon the offeror's previous experience? What evidence of historically incurred hours has the offeror provided? Or, is the proposal an engineering estimate of the projected labor and expertise to accomplish the requirements of the acquisition? Do the proposed hours correspond to the performance period?

**Audit/Technical Recommendation**  
Second subparagraph. Summarize the basis of the audit or other recommendations. How have the recommended labor rates been developed? For instance, audit reports generally use the Data Resources Indices in developing labor rate recommendations. This has been proven to be a reliable escalation predictor for labor rates and material items. If you have an audit report, the information for this subparagraph will be within the audit report. In the event you have not obtained an audit, it is advisable to contact your state audit office and request current rate recommendations. The recommendations of the technical evaluation should also be addressed under this subparagraph. It is important that the evaluation includes complete and factual support for any exceptions taken to proposed direct labor categories and hours.

**Pre-negotiation Objective**  
Third subparagraph. Discuss the Grantee's negotiation objective. What is it based upon? Did you rely on the audit recommendations? Did you rely on the technical evaluation in development of your objective labor categories and hours? An excellent resource for additional considerations during analysis of a proposal is the Armed Services Pricing Manual, ASPM. Additionally, the evaluation considerations in evaluating manufacturing labor in lieu of engineering labor differ greatly. In a manufacturing environment, other considerations may include application of learning curve theory, efficiency factors, recurring versus non-recurring labor, etc.  
It is your responsibility to establish a reasonable objective after considering and analyzing all of the available data. Statements to the effect, "THE OFFEROR HAS PROPOSED THE SAME RATES ON OTHER CONTRACTS," are not adequate without discussion of how price reasonableness was determined under the other contracts.

---

**(2) Labor Overhead, Material Overhead, and G&A**  
Compare, in detailed discussion, the offeror's proposal, the audit and/or other recommendations, and the Grantee's objective for labor overhead, material overhead, and G&A. For example:

| Category          | Offeror's Proposal | Audit/Technical Recommendation | Pre-negotiation Objective |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Labor Overhead    | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $ | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $           | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $       |
| Material Overhead | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $ | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $           | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $       |
| G&A               | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $ | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $           | Rate: x%<br>Amt: $       |


 


**Offeror's Proposal**  
First subparagraph. Describe how the offeror developed the proposed indirect rates. Does a forward pricing rate agreement exist? If so, what is the period covered by the agreement? This information should be provided by the offeror.

**Audit/Other Recommendation**  
Second subparagraph. Explain what the audit's recommendations are based upon. This may include exceptions taken to some cost elements within the overhead pool, such as fringe benefits, unemployment taxes, rent, depreciation, etc. This information should be reflected in the audit report. If you do not obtain an audit report, you can request current rate recommendations and/or historical actual rates from your state audit office. Comparing the offeror's proposed rates to the actual rates can provide a good measure on how accurate the offeror's proposed rates have been.

**Pre-negotiation Objective**  
Third paragraph. Address how you developed the Grantee's pre-negotiation objective, and upon what information you relied. Are your objective rates based upon recommendations? Occasionally, you may experience a situation where you haven't obtained an audit report, and your state audit office has no information on a specific offeror. In such cases, it may be to your advantage to request an audit of the offeror's rates. Absent this information, you will need to evaluate the offeror's proposed rates in detail (i.e., cost elements included in the indirect pools) for allowability and allocability. Comparing one offeror's rates with those of another offeror's is not an acceptable method in any case. Also, comparing this year's proposed rates to last year's rates is not a basis for establishing reasonableness of the currently proposed rate.

**(3) Direct Material**  
Provide a detailed breakdown and compare, in detailed discussions, the offeror's material quantities and unit prices.

| Material   | Offeror's Proposal        | Technical/Audit Recommendation | Pre-negotiation Objective |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Pwr Sup    | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $   | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ |
| CM Chips   | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $   | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ |
| Wire       | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $   | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ |
| Other      | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $   | Qty: xx<br>UP: $<br>Amt: $ |
| Total      | $                        | $                             | $                        |


**Offeror's Proposal**  
First subparagraph. Address the basis of the offeror's proposed direct material (engineering estimate? based upon history?, etc.) and costs associated with the material (catalog prices? oral quotes? written quotes? historical prices escalated by $?, competitive?, etc.) Will there be any scrap, attrition or variance factors to consider? If applicable, has the offeror included an analysis for large dollar items? Is the analysis meaningful?

**Audit/Technical Recommendation**  
Second subparagraph. Address the audit/technical recommendations. Has the auditor/originator taken exception to any of the proposed material items, quantities or associated prices? Have exceptions been adequately supported?

**Pre-negotiation Objective**  
Third subparagraph. Support the Grantee's pre-negotiation objective. If you have taken exception to any material items and/or quantities, what information have you relied upon to reach your conclusions? If you have taken exception to any pricing aspects of the offeror's proposal, explain fully how you arrived at your objective. In cases where you have no audit report, the importance of a thorough technical evaluation is increased. You must make a determination of price reasonableness for the direct material items. When challenging a cost, explain the basis for your position. "Appears too high," without rationale, is not sufficient.

---

**(4) Other Direct Costs (ODC)**  
Compare, in detailed discussions, the offeror's proposal, the audit and/or technical recommendation, and the pre-negotiation objective for other direct costs. For example:

| Cost Element      | Offeror's Proposal | Technical/Audit Recommendation | Pre-negotiation Objective |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Computer Support  | $               | $                             | $                        |
| Freight           | $               | $                             | $                        |
| Air Travel        | $               | $                             | $                        |
| Per Diem          | $               | $                             | $                        |
| Consultant        | $               | $                             | $                        |
| Total ODC         | $               | $                             | $                        |

**Offeror's Proposal**  
First subparagraph. Summarize the offeror's rationale for proposing the various expenses. The elements above are examples of the types of costs generally included as other direct costs (ODC).

**Technical/Audit Recommendation**  
Second subparagraph. Summarize the audit and/or technical recommendations. Address all the items included under this element. Any exceptions taken must be fully explained.

**Pre-negotiation Objective**  
Third paragraph. Provide an analysis of the items included under this cost element. For instance, are the number of trips scheduled considered reasonable by audit or your technical evaluation? Are the costs per trip reasonable? You can check air travel rates with commercial airlines. How does the offeror's proposed costs compare with previous history? Did the contractor apply an escalation factor? Is it reasonable? In your analysis, you may need to show a lower level breakdown (i.e., a breakdown of the number and location of proposed trips).

---

**(5) Profit/Fee Analysis**  
Provide a summary which compares the offeror's proposal and the Grantee's pre-negotiation objective. For example:

| Offeror's Proposal      | Pre-negotiation Objective |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Rate: xx%<br>Amt: $    | Rate: xx%<br>Amt: $      |



**Offeror's Proposal**  
First subparagraph. State the offeror's proposed profit/fee rate, that amount, and any other information provided by the offeror to support the proposed rate.

**Pre-negotiation Objective**  
Second subparagraph. Address the Grantee's pre-negotiation objective profit/fee rate which should be based upon application of your structured approach.

- Structured approaches for determining profit or fee pre-negotiation objectives provide a discipline for ensuring that all relevant factors are considered.  
- Grantees should use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee objective in those acquisitions that require cost analysis; and  
- May prescribe specific exemptions for situations in which mandatory use of a structured approach would be clearly inappropriate.  
- Profit or fee pre-negotiation objectives do not necessarily represent net income to contractors. Rather, they represent that element of the potential total remuneration that contractors may receive for contract performance over and above allowable costs. This potential remuneration element and the Grantee's estimate of allowable costs to be incurred in contract performance together equal the Grantee's total pre-negotiation objective. Just as actual costs may vary from estimated costs, the contractor's actual realized profit or fee may vary from negotiated profit or fee, because of such factors as efficiency of performance, incurrence of costs the Grantee does not recognize as allowable and contract type.  

It is in the Grantee's interest to offer contractors opportunities for financial rewards sufficient to (1) stimulate efficient contract performance, and (2) attract the best capabilities of qualified large and small business concerns to Grantee contracts.  
Both the Grantee and contractor should be concerned with profit as a motivator of efficient and effective contract performance. Negotiations aimed merely at reducing prices by reducing profit, without proper recognition of the function of the profit, are not in the Grantee's interest.


## Part D: Type of Contract Contemplated 

Explain the type of contract contemplated and the rationale for selection. If this pre-negotiation memorandum is being written for a modification to an existing contract, you must also address the contract type.

## Part E: Major Differences 

Identify any anticipated problem areas, exceptions taken by the offeror(s) to the solicitation terms and conditions, or major differences which may interfere with negotiations, and your intended negotiation strategy.

## Part F: Negotiation Approval Sought

Give your specific recommendation similar to the following:

"Approval of this Pre-Negotiation Memorandum is recommended based upon the information set forth herein and authority to negotiate and enter into a contract is requested. It is considered the opinion of the negotiator that the Grantee's pre-negotiation objectives are realistic and can be achieved."
