## 1. Review the procurement request and supporting documents

2. Have all the necessary technical requirement data (including delivery dates, quantities, specifications, and drawings) been supplied?  
3. Has negotiation been properly justified?  
4. Have proper authorities given approval, including authority to negotiate?  
5. Have all the appropriation data (including data as to when funds must be obligated and when they lapse) been supplied?

1. Review the statement relating to the specification and other descriptive matter to see that:  
   - (a) They are complete, clear, realistic, and not unnecessarily restrictive.  
   - (b) They contain no conflicting statements or requirements.  
   - (c) They include no uncertainties that may cause offerors to ask questions, take exceptions, or cover themselves by unnecessary contingency factors.  
   - (d) They are current, when standard specifications are involved (except, of course, when replacement parts or existing equipment require other specifications).  

2. Check for special features, such as:  
   - (a) Special inspection requirements.  
   - (b) Special delivery requirements, such as multiple destinations.  
   - (c) Qualified product requirements.

3. When necessary, consult with cognizant technical personnel to:  
   - (a) Clarify omissions or discrepancies.  
   - (b) Obtain needed background.  
   - (c) Learn about similar related procurements.  
   - (d) Determine what data should be submitted with quotations or proposals.
