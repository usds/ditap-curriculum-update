***Tailor all aspects of this template to the individual acquisition and ensure that any template areas providing sample language or instructions (e.g. italicized and/or red language) are deleted prior to submission.*** 

## Proposed debriefing agenda

**1. Introductions**
- Identify the Government debriefing team. (Have the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and Counsel attend the debriefing, as needed.)   
- Identify those individuals representing the debriefed Offeror in the debriefing. (Obtain, in advance, the names and positions/titles of all Contractor personnel who will attend.)  
- Identify a responsible party to take minutes of the debriefing for inclusion in the official debriefing summary (see number 10 in this template). 

**2. Purpose of the Debriefing**
- Provide rationale for excluding the debriefed Offeror from competition (if applicable).
- Reduce misunderstanding and instill confidence that the Offeror was treated fairly.
- Assure the Offeror that proposals were evaluated in accordance with the Solicitation, as well as applicable laws and regulations.
- Identify weaknesses in the Offeror’s proposal, so the Offeror can better prepare proposals for future acquisitions.
- Reduce misunderstandings that would otherwise lead to a protest.
- Provide an explanation of the source selection decision.
- Give the Offeror an opportunity to provide feedback regarding the RFP, discussions, evaluations, and the source selection process. (The Contracting Officer may choose to broach this at the onset of the meeting but then allow the Offeror to provide a response at the end of the debriefing. See number 9(d) in this template). *Caution*: A debriefing is not a debate or defense of the Government’s award decision or evaluation results\!

**3. Ground Rules and Agenda**
- Provide debriefing material and control the agenda. 
- Review/refer to the letter/written information that the Contracting Officer has already provided the Offeror, if applicable. (For instance, if the Contracting Officer provided a written debriefing letter to the Offeror prior to the debriefing meeting, refer to this letter.) 
- Explain that the debriefing IS NOT and WILL NOT include the following:
   * A page-by-page review/analysis of the Offeror’s proposal. 
   * A point-by-point comparison with other proposals. 
   * A debate or defense of the Government’s award decision or evaluation results. 
   * Proprietary information exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). 
   * Any information prohibited from disclosure by [FAR 24.202](http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2024_2.html#wp1074025) or exempt from release under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552). 

**4. Source Selection Process Brief Review**
- FAR Parts 13 or 15 brief discussion, as applicable. 
- Define Best Value – Cost/Technical Tradeoff (or discuss Low Price Technically Acceptable, if applicable).

**5. Evaluation Factors/Subfactors**
- Review and provide overview of the Factors/Subfactors. 
- Focus on the significant Factors and explain the rating definitions.

**6. Source Selection Organization** 
- Identify team members by title/position/experience, but not by name, unless the Source Selection Authority (SSA)/SSEB is in attendance. 
   * Goal of this discussion is to assure the Offeror that highly qualified personnel evaluated its proposal in accordance with the RFP and applicable laws and regulations. 

**7. Evaluation Results**
- Disclose Government’s evaluation of any significant weaknesses or deficiencies in the offer. 
   * When determining whether something was a strength or weakness, consider whether it impacted the evaluation rating in any way.
   * If a weakness was significant enough to include during discussions, it is probably significant enough to mention during the debriefing.  
- Discuss past performance information on the debriefed Offeror. (Do *not* reveal names of individuals who provided past performance information.)

**8. Overall Rankings**
- Disclose the overall rankings of all Offerors when any ranking was developed by the agency during the source selection. However, DO NOT use or associate the rankings in a way that would identify the other unsuccessful Offerors. Use numbers or letters to indicate other Offerors to conceal their identities. The Contracting Officer may identify the ratings of the awardee but only at a high (Factor) level. Do not defend/discuss any ratings shown for the awardee. 
- Disclose the overall evaluated cost or price (including unit prices) and technical rating, if applicable, of the successful Offeror and the debriefed Offeror. 
   * DO NOT disclose any specific Government cost/price adjustments to the awardee’s proposed costs/prices.  
- Include any significant cost realism adjustments that might have been made at the major cost element level for the debriefed Offeror. 

**9. Rationale for Award Decision**
- Provide a summary of the rationale for the contract award decision (this information is in the Source Selection Authority Decision Document or the Business Clearance Memorandum (BCM)). If using the Source Selection Decision Document or the BCM to do this, the Contracting Officer (working with Counsel and FOIA) must redact, prior to release, evaluation information concerning the other unsuccessful Offerors and any other information not releasable under FOIA. 
- Only release the total evaluated price of the other unsuccessful Offerors if they agree to the release or the agency determines that release would not cause any future competitive harm. 
- For acquisitions of commercial items, provide the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful Offeror. 
- Provide responses to relevant questions about whether source selection procedures contained in the Solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed. 

**10. Prepare a Debriefing Memorandum for the Contract File**
- List all attendees. 
- Provide a summary of information disclosed during the debriefing.
- Attach any charts or other presentation materials.
- Include all questions and answers discussed at the debriefing.
- Include any relevant information provided subsequent to the debriefing.
