## I. Overview & Objectives

In this session, learners apply insights from solution evaluation to define acquisition strategies and draft components of a user-centered solicitation. This session is grounded in Milestone 3 of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study, which asks learners to write a Statement of Objectives (SOO), define evaluation criteria, and choose a corresponding evaluation method.

**Learning Objectives:**
* Draft a clear Statement of Objectives (SOO) based on discovery and solution analysis  
* Define evaluation factors that reflect key performance needs and constraints  
* Identify an evaluation method aligned to solution complexity and risks

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to deepen application of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case. It is *not part of the original case study* but builds on previous milestones to help learners connect evaluation decisions to solicitation design. |

## III. Session Agenda & Activities

**Activity:** Designing a Solicitation Strategy  
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Purpose:** Guide learners in crafting key solicitation components rooted in previous discovery and evaluation work.

**Instructions:**

- **Begin with a short recap**: What were the key trade-offs from the previous case study session? How do those inform your solicitation strategy?  
- **Prompt**: “If your team has decided on a solution path, how do you ensure the solicitation invites the right responses from vendors?”  
- **Introduce the deliverable**:  
   * A short Statement of Objectives (SOO)  
   * A recommendation for evaluation criteria and method
- **In teams**:  
   * Draft the SOO based on your chosen CRM strategy  
   * Define 2–3 evaluation factors and describe what a strong response would look like  
   * Choose and justify an evaluation method (e.g., LPTA, trade-off)  
        - Encourage teams to root decisions in user needs, solution fit, and past case milestones  
- **Quick share-out**:  
   * Each team presents their SOO and evaluation logic  
   * Facilitator offers warm feedback or points of tension

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Draft SOOs with clear alignment to discovery and evaluation  
* Evaluation approaches that balance complexity, risk, and clarity  
* Justification for methods that reflect FAR flexibilities and digital service goals

**Optional Extension Ideas:**
* **Peer Review Rotation:** Learners rotate to peer review SOOs and evaluation strategies using a feedback checklist  
* **Debrief the Decision:** Select teams defend their proposed strategy in a mock IPT setting with other learners asking questions and raising potential risks

## IV. Next Steps

* Refine SOO and evaluation approach and prepare for Milestone 4  
* Acquisition Strategy Development  
  * Performance-Based Contracting: Focus on delivery outcomes and mission effectiveness rather than compliance  
  * Modular Contracting
