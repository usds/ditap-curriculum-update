# Activity: Stakeholder Selection and Interview Assignment 

**Assignment Overview:**

You’ll be introduced to this stakeholder engagement assignment during class, but we’re sharing this description in advance to give you a preview of what’s to come.  
In this two-part activity, you’ll identify the key individuals within your agency who influence or control decisions around digital service acquisitions. Then, you’ll begin developing a strategy for how to effectively engage with them—using insights and experiences from this program as a starting point for those conversations.

**Activity Goal:** By completing this activity, you will: 

1. Gain a better understanding of your agency's readiness for change and innovation,  
2. Practice influence conversations, and  
3. Build your digital services network.

## Instructions – Part 1: Prepare

For Part 1 of this activity, you’ll identify 2-4 people within your agency that you don’t usually have a chance to interact with but who you see as a significant influencer or gatekeeper (e.g., CIO, HCA, CAO, SPE, CFO, Policy Office leader). You may want to create a map (in Visio, PowerPoint, or another mind mapping software) like the sample Stakeholder Landscape graphic, but refine it to mirror the specific stakeholders you need to engage.  This will help you see the potential pool of stakeholders and aid you in narrowing your selection.

1\. Narrow down your list to 2-4 key stakeholders based on the following assumptions:  

* The most significant perceived level of influence or control over the progress of digital services procurements (stakeholders differ in their level of influence and control)  
* Their perceived level of influence or control over the progress of acquisition, generally in the agency  
* Their potential involvement in your role as a future agency ambassador for digital services acquisition 

2\. Conduct basic research on the person and develop hypotheses you would like to test during the conversation. Consider this conversation as a starting point to test your assumptions about their influence in the digital services acquisition process and their role in leading change and innovation in your agency. Basic considerations:

* Position   
* Years in position
* Relationship of the other person to me
* Span of responsibilities  
* Work history  
* Personality  
* Strengths/Weaknesses  
*  Formal/Informal roles in the acquisition lifecycle  
*  Formal/Informal connections and relationships with other primary stakeholders

3\. Hypothesize potential benefits and challenges to their engagement in digital services acquisition. Below are some example hypotheses you can develop about your stakeholders:

* Their role can positively affect the acquisition of digital services in the future. Explore the interconnections between their goals and creating agile acquisition methods that are faster, improve quality, and improve outcomes.
* What is their influence over the acquisition process, and in what parts of it do they play approval, advisory, or recommendation roles?  
* Leaders and stakeholders are called on to lead change and innovation in their agencies. What change or innovation efforts have they been involved in? What lessons can we learn from those initiatives that will benefit digital services acquisition?  
* Change raises issues and concerns in agencies regarding risk, ability to meet mission, cost and financial impacts, employee satisfaction, culture, and other factors. Agile digital services acquisition is a change for the agency in identifying needs, conducting the acquisition process, working with contractors, and iteratively achieving outcomes. What concerns do they have regarding the needed changes to embrace digital services acquisition?

4\. While the main goal of this conversation may be to learn about the influencer or gatekeeper, this individual will also be forming their own impression of you. Think about how you would like to position yourself and what influence you will have on this person.

* Anticipate possible questions the person may have about your background and experience. Depending on the stakeholder, you may have greater expertise in agile and acquisition innovation than your stakeholder does.  
* Take time to review the online learning module on influence to learn about different approaches to the conversation.  
* Identify whether the influencer or gatekeeper may become a future advocate or champion for agile and digital services acquisition.

5\. After brainstorming, use the second page of the Stakeholder Holder Interests template to develop your conversation structure. Completing this information will help you feel more prepared for the conversation. You can use the following resources to help you prepare for the interviews: 

* Use the [Stakeholder Interests Template](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3A_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/1_Vendor-Materials/Stakeholder%20Interview%20Assignment/Stakeholder_Interest_Template.md) to identify opportunities and challenges in working with stakeholders and to establish a framework for your interview with a stakeholder.  
* Use the [Stakeholder Interview Guide Template](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3A_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/1_Vendor-Materials/Stakeholder%20Interview%20Assignment/Stakeholder_Interview_Guide_Template.md) to identify questions to ask your stakeholders.  
* [Assignment FAQs](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3A_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/1_Vendor-Materials/Stakeholder%20Interview%20Assignment/Stakeholder%20Assignment%20FAQs.md)

**For your interview, keep in mind the following:**

* **Purpose:** Why are you having this conversation? What are you trying to achieve?  
* **Structure:** How will I open the conversation? What strategies will I use during the conversation? What does success and the next steps look like?  
* **Resources:** What information must you gather to prepare for the conversation?

6\. Practice your conversation with a cohort member and enlist their feedback. Use their feedback to polish your engagement strategy. This is optional.

**Definition of Done & Deadline for Completion:** Part 1 must be completed in Module 2\. By the end of Module 2, you will need to provide a document for approval that includes: 

* The four stakeholders you intend to interview  
* Your list of questions you plan to ask for feedback (Optional).

## Instructions \- Part 2: Engage

These interviews will test your hypotheses about the sphere of influence for your stakeholder selections and give you experience conducting influencing conversations.

Document your interviews and reflect on the conversation and your strategy for future engagement using the following questions:

* How accurate was your hypothesis on the amount of influence and control this person has on the acquisition process?   
* How accurate was your hypothesis on their role in leading change and innovation at your agency?  
* How influenced were they by your insights or ideas? How was this evidenced? Were they motivated or energized by your conversation?  
* Would you change anything that would have made the conversation more productive? Were you able to have them "put down" any previous baggage they might have associated with the acquisition process?  
* How does this conversation impact your future conversations with this stakeholder?  
* What is your plan for further engagement with this stakeholder?

Please include the date of your interview and an overview of what you discussed. You should also share your insights from the interview with your classmates.   

**Definition of Done & Deadline for Completion:** 

To consider this activity completed, you’ll need to adequately prepare for and complete interviews with 2-4 influencer/gatekeepers at your agency and share insights through a written assignment submitted to the Team.
