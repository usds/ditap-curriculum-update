# Activity: RFI Reality Check — Using AI to Strengthen Industry Engagement

**Purpose**

This activity helps you practice evaluating a real-world Request for Information (RFI) through the lens of modern digital acquisition practices. You'll use Lumen, an AI-powered tool, to identify areas for improvement and recommend changes that support clearer, more outcomes-focused communication with industry.

## Instructions

**Step 1**: Pair Up
- Work with a partner or small group (2–3 people).

**Step 2**: Choose an RFI
- Visit [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov) and find a current or recent RFI related to:
    * Digital services  
    * IT modernization  
    * Tech platform support

*Download or copy the language from the RFI to use in the next step*.

**Step 3**: Analyze the RFI in Lumen
* Use [Lumen](https://g2xchange.com/meet-lumen) to examine the RFI language.  
* Use the AI to help answer questions like:  
  * What is this RFI trying to achieve?  
  * What’s unclear or ambiguous?  
  * What’s missing that industry would need to know to respond effectively?  
  * Does this RFI encourage or discourage agile/digital vendors from responding?  
  * How well does it reflect an iterative, outcomes-based approach?
* Take notes on what you learn from Lumen and where you agree or disagree.

**Step 4**: Compare and Improve

With your group:

* Discuss how your analysis compares with Lumen’s insights.  
* Decide what *you* would change if you were the Contracting Officer.  
* Identify at least three concrete edits that would:  
  * Improve clarity  
  * Align the RFI with digital service delivery  
  * Help attract the right vendors
* Use the space below to jot down your proposed edits:

1.    
2.    
3.  

**Step 5**: Report Back

Be ready to share a brief (2-minute) summary with the class:
* The RFI you selected  
* Key insights from Lumen  
* Your top recommended improvements

### Outcome

By the end of the activity, you’ll understand how to use AI tools like Lumen to validate that your market research communications are clear, intentional, and designed to attract qualified, modern vendors.
