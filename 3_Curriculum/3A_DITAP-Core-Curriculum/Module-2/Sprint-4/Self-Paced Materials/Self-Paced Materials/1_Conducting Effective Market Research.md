# Introduction to Conducting Effective Market Research
**Module 2 Sprint 4**
> _Average completion time: 2 - 2.5 hours_

Effective market research is the cornerstone of a successful digital services acquisition. It provides the critical insights needed to align government needs with real-world capabilities and ensures the resulting solicitations are grounded in an understanding of current technologies, vendor landscapes, and user expectations. In today’s fast-paced digital environment, traditional approaches to research often fall short, requiring a shift toward more agile, creative, and user-informed techniques.

This sprint equips acquisition professionals with the tools, methods, and mindset needed to conduct meaningful market research. Learners will explore resources like the Gartner Magic Quadrant, discover unconventional data sources such as open GitHub repositories and Reddit communities, and develop a personalized Acquisition Toolkit to capture ideas, tools, and strategies for future use. By blending structured analysis with flexible exploration, participants will learn to generate actionable intelligence that supports smart, user-centered procurement decisions.

The recent implementation of FAR Part 39 has elevated the importance of market research for IT acquisitions, requiring acquisition professionals to develop a deeper understanding of technolgoy markets, commercial practices, and emerging trends. Similarly, enhanced FAR Part 6 requirements emphasize the critical role of market research in ensuring full and open competition while leveraging the best available solutions.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this sprint, participants will be able to:

* Explain the role of market research in shaping effective digital acquisitions
* Distinguish between market research and market intelligence, and describe how each informs procurement
* Identify and apply a variety of digital tools and sources for gathering market data
* Use frameworks like the **Gartner Magic Quadrant** to segment vendor capabilities based on customer needs
* Build a personalized **Acquisition Toolkit** to document useful research methods, resources, and lessons learned
* Assess how data-driven insights from market research can improve requirements definition and vendor engagement

## Build your personalized acquisition toolkit

As you move through this course, you’ll be exposed to a wide range of market research tools, strategies, and resources. But not everything will resonate with everyone. That’s why you’ll create your own Acquisition Toolkit—a living, personal resource that helps you capture what works for *you*, what you want to explore more, and what might help you in real-world procurement work.

This toolkit is yours to build and shape. Use it to document:

* New tools or websites you discover  
* Blogs, articles, or guides you found helpful  
* Concepts or ideas you want to try in your work  
* Data sources or vendor lists you want to keep handy  
* Questions or reflections as you test ideas

By the end of the course, this toolkit becomes a go-to reference guide, a record of your learning journey, and a cheat sheet for future procurements.

**Example resources you might include:**

* A Medium blog post that helped you understand the Software as a Service (SaaS) marketplace  
* A link to [Reddit’s r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/) for understanding IT culture  
* A useful past Request for Information (RFI) on [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov)  
* A federal GitHub repo you didn’t know existed  
* A source for open datasets like [data.gov](https://data.gov)  
* A PDF of a General Services Administration (GSA) Emerging Tech report  
* A quote or idea from a guest speaker you want to remember  
* A visualization tool or AI prompt that saved you time

**Concepts you might want to try:**

* Use a short video in future RFIs to explain context.  
* Send a Google Form instead of a 5-page RFI.  
* Try drafting a “challenge brief” instead of a traditional Statement of Objectives (SOO).

**Helpful articles, blogs, or posts:**

* *“How Startups Read Your RFI” – Medium post* → Gave me a new perspective on industry’s point of viewPOV  
* *DSC’s Guide to AI in Procurement* → Helped clarify what’s hype vs helpful

**Data sources and reports:**

* [Data.gov](https://data.gov) → For understanding digital inclusion metrics  
* Government Accountability Office (GAO) Reports on Agile Contracts → Reference for senior leadership buy-in

**Ongoing questions:**

* How do I figure out if I’m asking too much in my RFI?  
* When is it okay to skip an RFI entirely?  
* How do small businesses *actually* find out about opportunities?

## The Magic Quadrant

The Magic Quadrant is a market research tool used by the market research firm Gartner. The Magic Quadrant tool helps you think about the market through the lens of your customer’s needs. As Gartner explains in its discussion of the Magic Quadrant, you can generally segment a market four ways as depicted in the Magic Quadrant below:

![A chart divided into four quadrants by horizontal and vertical axes. The horizontal axis is labeled "Completeness of Vision" and the vertical axis is labeled "Ability to Execute." The four quadrants are labeled as follows: Top Left: Challengers, Top Right: Leaders, Bottom Left: Niche Players, Bottom Right: Visionaries.](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9e4c0e623315e0cfe41418eedf977e06bf706f16/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/Gartner%20Magic%20Quadrant.png?raw=true)

Using a tool like this can help you further segment the market and make market research more efficient. Read more about the Gartner Magic Quadrant approach [here and how you can tailor it for your use](http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/research_mq.jsp). If you want to dive deeper into a current Gartner Quadrant, check [this one out from Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/recognition/analyst-relations/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-digital-experience-services.html). 

**How can you use this tool in your own work?**

As a federal contracting professional, you’ll often need to explore different types of solutions like commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), open source and proprietary software, to meet your agency’s digital service needs. One way to organize what you learn is by creating a simple comparison chart, like the Gartner Magic Quadrant. You can use it to quickly show how different options stack up based on what matters most to your customer. Try adapting the chart by changing up the labels on each axis relative to your customer’s needs. Here’s how to get started:

1. First, identify the characteristics of your customer’s needs. Who is the end user and what are their main concerns? Is it security, ease of use, cost, or another factor?  
2. Next, select the two most important characteristics and plot them on your own quadrant on each axis. For example, are your customer’s largest priorities security and price?  
3. Once you determine what your magic quadrant looks like, then begin to place vendors in each quadrant as they best fit. Plotting providers in the quadrants is a quick way to determine which companies deserve the most of your limited time and attention. Focus on those vendors in the section of your quadrant that is most important to your customer.  
4. As a final step, look at those vendors that are in the quadrant you are targeting. Narrow your follow-on research to that quadrant and focus on those characteristics. Determine if you need to do more market research to define your acquisition strategy and approach. You may want to discuss your findings with your team and be prepared to share them in class during the case study review and application activities.

## Market intelligence vs. market research

Market research is the process of gathering and analyzing information about capabilities within the commercial marketplace to benefit from its technologies and competitive forces in meeting an agency need. In contrast, market intelligence focuses on specific classes of customers, including demographic and geographic information and what they buy, all of which can help inform an analysis of business intelligence. [Read this short article](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4697-market-intelligence.html) and consider how market intelligence might help your agency in framing out an understanding of the commercial market.

## Responsible pre-solicitation communication

### Introduction

The Federal government spends over $500 billion yearly on goods and services. As an acquisition professional, you must complete every procurement you’re involved in as effectively, efficiently, and responsibly as possible to ensure taxpayer money is well-spent. One strategy that facilitates effective procurement is pre-solicitation communication. Pre-solicitation communication with vendors in the target market can help you access current market information and define requirements as clearly as possible. Ideally, it should begin well before the issuing of a solicitation.

There are two goals to this interaction: 

1. To improve procurement outcomes by obtaining as much information as possible regarding potential solutions from vendors before preparing a solicitation  
2. To better communicate government needs to vendors, so they will provide better-informed offers 

![The White House and a city connected by an arrow reading, "Information"](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/Govt%20Vendor%20Information%20Sharing.png?raw=true)


While the FAR allows for a good deal of flexibility in establishing pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors, some agencies are reluctant to exercise all of their options. They fear stepping over the line and causing protests or compromising procurement integrity. Vendors may also be reluctant to discuss requirements and solutions in the presence of potential competitors or may fear that talking privately to an agency could limit their future opportunities. However, open pre-solicitation communication with potential vendors is critical, especially in digital services procurement. Why is that the case? And how do you execute it effectively? You’ll learn the answers to these questions by completing this online learning.

### Module overview

After completing this module, you should be able to: 

* Discuss why pre-solicitation communication with offerors is essential in acquiring digital services  
* Describe ways you can communicate effectively with potential vendors before solicitation of digital services  
* Identify best practices for responsible pre-solicitation communication when procuring digital services
 
## Acquisition process myths 

To alleviate some of these concerns and encourage agencies to pursue all legitimate avenues of communication, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) developed two memoranda addressing 10 government and eight vendor “myths” regarding the acquisition process. Review these lists before you dig into this module, and then keep them in mind as you move forward. Many of the myths deal with responsible pre-solicitation (the focus of this module), but others apply to other phases in the acquisition lifecycle. Do your part as an acquisition myth-buster!

### Government myths

|   | Government Myth | Fact |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. | “We can’t meet one-on-one with a potential offeror.” | Government officials can meet one-on-one with potential offerors if no vendor receives preferential treatment. |
| 2\. | “Since communication with contractors is like communication with registered lobbyists, and since contact with lobbyists must be disclosed, more communication with contractors will involve a substantial additional disclosure burden, so we should avoid these meetings.” | Disclosure is required only in certain circumstances, such as for meetings with registered lobbyists. Many contractors don’t fall into this category, and even when disclosure is required, it is usually a minimal burden that should not prevent a useful meeting from occurring. |
| 3\. | “A protest is something to be avoided at all costs \- even if it means the government limits conversations with industry.” | Restricting communication won’t prevent a protest; it might increase the chance of one and deprive the government of potentially helpful information. |
| 4\. | “Conducting discussions/negotiations after receipt of proposals will add too much time to the schedule.” | Whether discussions should be conducted is a key decision for contracting officers to make. Avoiding discussions solely because of schedule concerns may be counterproductive and cause delays and other problems during contract performance. |
| 5\. | “If the government meets with vendors, that may cause them to submit an unsolicited proposal, which will delay the procurement process.” | Submission of an unsolicited proposal shouldn’t affect the schedule. Generally, the unsolicited proposal process is separate from the process for a known agency requirement that can be acquired using competitive methods. |
| 6\. | “When the government awards a task or delivery order using the Federal Supply Schedules, debriefing the offerors isn’t required, so it shouldn’t be done.” | Providing feedback is important for both offerors and the government, so agencies should generally provide feedback whenever possible. |
| 7\. | “Industry days and similar events attended by multiple vendors are of low value to industry and the government because industry won’t provide useful information in front of competitors, and the government doesn’t release new information.” | Well-organized industry days, pre-solicitation, and pre-proposal conferences are valuable opportunities for the government and potential vendors, both prime contractors and subcontractors, many of whom are small businesses. |
| 8\. | “The program manager already talked to the industry about developing the technical requirements, so the contracting officer doesn’t need to do anything else before issuing the Request for Proposal (RFP).” | The technical requirements are only part of the acquisition. Getting feedback on terms and conditions, pricing structure, performance metrics, evaluation criteria, and contract administration matters will improve the award and implementation process. |
| 9\. | “Giving industry only a few days to respond to an RFP is OK since the government has been talking to industry about this procurement for over a year.” | Providing short response times may result in the government receiving fewer proposals, and the ones received may not be as well-developed, which can lead to a flawed contract. This approach signals that the government isn’t interested in competition. |
| 10\. | “Getting broad participation by many different vendors is too difficult; we’re better off dealing with the established companies we know.” | The government loses when we limit ourselves to the companies we already work with. Instead, we must look for opportunities to increase competition and ensure that all vendors, including small businesses, are considered fairly. |

### Vendor myths

|  | Vendor Myth | Fact |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| 1\. | “The best way to present my company’s capabilities is by marketing directly to contracting officers and/or signing them up for my mailing list.” | Contracting officers and program managers are often inundated with general marketing material that doesn’t reach the right people at the right time. As an alternative, vendors can take advantage of the various outreach sessions that agencies hold to connect contracting officers and program managers with companies whose skills are needed. |
| 2\. | “It is a good idea to bring only business development and marketing people to meetings with the agency’s technical staff.” | In meetings with government technical personnel, bringing subject matter experts to the meeting is far more valuable than focusing on the sales pitch. |
| 3\. | “Attending industry days and outreach events isn’t valuable because the agency doesn’t provide new information.” | Industry days and outreach events can be valuable sources of information for potential vendors and are increasingly being used to leverage scarce staff resources. |
| 4\. | “Agencies generally have already determined their requirements and acquisition approach, so our impact during the pre-RFP phase is limited.” | Early and specific industry input is valuable. Agencies generally expend great effort collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the marketplace. It’s best to be as specific as possible about what works, what doesn’t, and how it can be improved. |
| 5\. | “If I meet one-on-one with agency personnel, they may share my proprietary data with my competition.” | Agency personnel are responsible for protecting proprietary information from disclosure outside the government and will not share it with other companies. |
| 6\. | “Agencies have an obligation not to share information about their contracts, such as prices, with other agencies, similar to the obligation they have not to disclose proprietary information to the public.” | There are no general limitations on disclosing information regarding existing contracts between agencies within the government. Agencies are encouraged to share pricing information to ensure we get the best value for our taxpayers. |
| 7\. | “To develop my new proposal, I don’t need to tailor my solution to the specific solicitation since the government won’t read my proposal that closely anyway.” | Offerors should tailor each proposal to the evaluation criteria, proposal instructions, and specific solicitation requirements to which they respond. Contracting officers and evaluation team members read proposals closely to ensure compliance with the proposal instructions. They must then evaluate them against the evaluation factors and the statement of work in the solicitation. |
| 8\. | “If I lose the competition, I shouldn’t bother to ask for a debriefing.” | Unsuccessful offerors should ask for a debriefing to understand the award decision and improve future proposals. |

## Why pre-solicitation communication matters 

Now that we’ve established it’s acceptable to engage with vendors and potential end-users beyond just a Request for Information (RFI) as pre-solicitation communication, let’s explore why doing so is beneficial.  

![Two panel cartoon with workers gathered around a table discussing an RFP](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/pre-solicitation%20communication%20cartoon.png?raw=true)


The cartoon shows that the government may issue a clear solicitation to them, only to have vendors interpret it differently when it “hits the street.” This is the situation illustrated in the above cartoon. If you avoid situations like the one in the cartoon and keep the lines of communication open between government and industry during the pre-solicitation phase, you’ll wind up with:

1. Better requirements  
2. Better bids  
3. Increased interoperability through shared standards

Let’s look at each of these. 

**1\. Pre-solicitation communication leads to better requirements** 

Let the experts be experts. This is particularly important in the digital services industry, where technology changes daily.

Industry representatives are constantly exposed to new technologies and must be aware of changing marketplace trends. Take advantage of their expertise on digital products and services you may be procuring to discover solutions and approaches you may not be aware of.

![two heads, one with a question, the other with an answer](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/questions%20answers.png?raw=true)


By engaging with potential vendors early on, you can solicit their feedback on what’s possible. You might learn your ideal solution may not be the best choice. 

What is available from the industry will inform other considerations when forming your requirements. For example, are you sure you want to build a custom digital service solution, or would a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution work with modification? These decisions will affect sustainment and maintenance. Technical data rights, intellectual property, long- and short-term costs, resources, and mission accomplishment priorities should be considered. 

**2\. Pre-solicitation communication results in better bids**

By engaging vendors in discussion and information sharing before issuing a solicitation, you condition the market to submit more constructive proposals. Vendors can’t submit good offers on what they don’t understand. Communicating about what you want to buy and sharing your vision for the contract outcome helps the industry:

* Prepare for pursuit, including finding teaming partners  
* Decrease the overall business costs by allowing them to plan and forecast more accurately  
* Find labor and other resources in advance rather than during the proposal

Answering questions about the acquisition this early may seem tedious, but it will save time and money once the solicitation is released. If you release a solicitation without effective communication, you’ll be flooded with dozens of questions as industry attempts to clarify their understanding of your need. When this occurs after your solicitation has already “hit the street,” it can cause delays and extensions to the proposal due date, which is disruptive to your program and costly for industry.

**3\. Pre-solicitation communication results in shared standards and increased interoperability**

You may be operating on outdated or inappropriate standards for a particular digital services requirement. Pre-solicitation communication with industry allows vendors to tell you that and to suggest more effective and efficient alternatives for current and future requirements.

On the other hand, if you know of a standard or requirement (e.g., Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)) for an upcoming acquisition, why not publish it ahead of time rather than only include it in solicitations? Make the standards known to industry as far in advance as possible so they may incorporate them into their commercial products and other offerings.

### Knowledge check
Answering questions about a potential acquisition from vendors before a solicitation is released may result in:  

- [[ ]] A. Delays and extensions to the due date
- [[X]] B. Better bids (correct)
- [[ ]] C. Charges of unethical behavior
- [[X]] D. Lower costs (correct)

## How to communicate effectively 

By now, you can explain why pre-solicitation communication is important. Let’s take a few minutes to look at how to do it most effectively. Here are a few tips:

### 1\. Provide foundational information

Think of the information you have to provide in the shape of a pyramid. The background and mission of your agency program form the foundation of that pyramid, and the other elements are built on top of that foundation. When going into the market research phase, you may not know the constraints, requirements, timelines, and resources you have or need for the acquisition. Utilize market research to get information that will help guide the requirements development process and determine the rest of the information needed for a solicitation. 

![A pyramid diagram illustrating a hierarchy for effective communication, from a broad base to a narrow top: Background and Mission, Desired Outcomes, Constraints, Timelines and Resources, and Reqs (Requirements)](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/communicate%20effectively%20pyramid.png?raw=true)


Read about each building block of the pyramid above. 

| Category | Key Points |
|----------|------------|
| **Background and Mission** | - Acquisitions must support the agency’s mission.<br>- Provide vendors with mission context, end users, and their challenges.<br>- Share lessons learned or retrospectives from prior acquisitions to avoid repeating mistakes. |
| **Desired Outcomes** | - Outcomes drive acquisition requirements (align with Digital Services Playbook, Play #1).<br>- Focus on enabling user outcomes rather than just compliance.<br>- Market research is less effective without a clear product vision or success criteria. |
| **Constraints** | - Conditions that limit vendor solutions (e.g., cybersecurity, policies, server environments).<br>- Avoid unnecessary constraints to reduce cost and foster innovation.<br>- Some constraints are essential; be transparent where possible. |
| **Timelines and Resources** | - Vendors need clarity on schedules, funding, and available government resources.<br>- Examples: <br> • Will development/testing occur on government or vendor servers?<br> • What’s achievable in 2 years vs. 2 months?<br> • What is the budget range?<br>- Consider sharing broad ranges instead of exact figures to explore trade-offs and possible solutions. |
| **Requirements** | - Derived from mission, outcomes, constraints, timelines, and market research.<br>- Define what the contract must realistically deliver.<br>- Can be communicated via a **Statement of Work (SOW)** or **Statement of Objectives (SOO)**.<br>- Early drafts are acceptable; requirements may evolve with further input and staff expertise. |

### 2\. Engage early with industry regarding opportunities

As you’ve learned throughout this module, engaging early with industry is critical in the ever-evolving digital services market. To facilitate communication, consider using the following traditional and non-traditional techniques.

**Non-traditional ways to engage with industry**: Our acquisition environment is ever changing, and so must our methods for conducting market research and communicating with vendors. Today, the government uses new techniques to engage with industry early on in the process and to reach non-traditional vendors who may or may not already do business with the government. 

These techniques include but are not limited to the following:
- MVPs and challenges  
- Reverse industry days  
- Market surveys  
- Virtual industry day webinar or videos  
- Blogs and social media  
- Similar industry experts  
- Using a 3rd party to conduct market research  

---

**MVPs & challenges.** MVPs and challenges help test acquisition hypotheses to determine how best to conduct a full solicitation for a product. They allow for a lightweight way to determine if a particular platform, service, or tool can be implemented in an agency or solve an agency problem before making a significant investment. These approaches prove that the platform, service, or tool works or doesn’t work via actual delivery; they get a functioning solution from end users to see how well they respond. This reduces overall risk and lets an agency try before it buys. Contrast this with long-term market analysis reports that provide helpful information but don’t allow you to try and test with end users.

![A hand-drawn blue circular brushstroke framing the red text, 'Do the minimum needed to test your product'](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/MVP.png?raw=true)


**MVPs:** The Minimum Viable Product (MVP), or alpha delivery, can be complex. In product development, the minimum viable product (MVP) has just enough features to gather “validated learning” about the product and its continued development. It uses a minimum investment to test a product. An MVP tests the actual usage scenario in contrast to conventional market research that relies on surveys or focus groups, often providing misleading results. 

>The popular file-sharing system [Dropbox](https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/) started as an MVP.

![Challenges](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/Challenges.jpg?raw=true)

**Challenges:** Challenges are a great way to test out pilots or prototypes – get small MVPs created without going through the formal acquisition process. Also, it is potentially a way to encourage the open-source community to interact with the government. It does not require that individuals or companies be registered with a DUNS number, unless the challenge rules call for that specifically. [Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/) has a complete list of current challenges and how to use them.

![Reverse Industry Days](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/9880ab6459925115e3955f9dfa2fcb6dab254752/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/Module-2-Media/IndustryDays.jpg?raw=true)

**Reverse industry days:** When determining where to take market research and how to understand what is available in a certain technology sector, a reverse industry day is a great market research tool. Short presentations allow the industry to tell the government what existing solutions can meet the problem. There is no specific FAR reference to these. Still, they are becoming more common and in the digital service sector could be very beneficial to finding and getting companies interested in telling the government what kind of products or services exist that can meet our needs without a formal “RFI” process having to be completed first. Here are a few recent examples:

---

**Market surveys:** A market research survey is a more informal, flexible method for collecting targeted information from potential vendors. It’s usually distributed as a questionnaire and can include a mix of multiple-choice, scaled, and open-ended questions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Surveys are short and specific (often 10–20 questions) 
* They are sent via email, Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, etc.  
* They gauge vendor capabilities, interest, experience, business size, or appropriate NAICS codes  
* Surveys can be anonymous or low-commitment  
* They’re easy to analyze and compare responses 
* They allow you to test evaluation criteria, maturity models, or service needs before writing an RFI

**Summary comparison**

| Feature | Market Research Survey | Request for Information (RFI) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Formality** | Informal | Formal, part of the acquisition record |
| **Length** | Short survey (10–20 questions) | Longer with attachments or drafts |
| **Posting** | Direct to vendors or targeted | Publicly posted (e.g., SAM.gov) |
| **Purpose** | Quick insight, validation | Deeper insight, planning procurements |
| **Response Effort** | Low | Medium to high |
| **Outcome** | Inform strategic thinking | Shapes solicitation structure |

You can distribute your survey in several ways, such as posting it with your RFI or sending it directly to vendors via email.

If your agency allows the use of Google products, you might consider creating your survey in **Google Forms** to make distributing and collecting responses easier.

**Virtual industry day webinar or videos:**   
​In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual industry days have become a prevalent method for government agencies to engage with industry partners. Hosting a virtual industry day allows for broader participation, enabling companies from various locations to access critical information without traveling. Recording these sessions ensures that those unable to attend live can view the presentations conveniently. An added advantage of virtual platforms is the ability for participants to submit questions anonymously, fostering more open discussions around requirements and reducing the reticence often observed in traditional in-person industry days.

Examples of virtual industry days:

* [Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Advance Planning Briefing for Industry (APBI):](https://www.army.mil/article/282863/registration_open_for_2025_army_contracting_virtual_outreach_for_industry?utm_source=chatgpt.com) In response to COVID-19 safety precautions, the MICC transitioned to a virtual format for its annual APBI event. This approach allowed small businesses and industry partners to engage in contracting forecasts and discussions without the need for physical attendance.  
* [PILCast Episode \#9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_FQM9yR_2Q) \- Innovative Techniques for Market Research: The PIL has experimented with incorporating videos into these solicitations to provide a more dynamic and comprehensive understanding of project needs.

**Blogs and social media:** Use blogs and social media, such as LinkedIn, to socialize an upcoming requirement or to engage a community around the problem you are trying to solve. Tell the compelling story of the agency and the need, and you will entice the kinds of companies who respond well to this type of outlet. Procurement language is formal and somewhat off-putting for a vibrant digital service community. By adapting to the community, we can show industry that we can learn their communication patterns and build trust from the first publication of the need.

**Similar industry experts:** Another way to interact with the industry is as an advisor. Finding an industry with similar challenges and problems as ours and discussing how they implement digital service techniques and solutions can help lend insight to how the commercial world buys these services. For example, Virgin Air has been awarded the Best Functional Web Design, Webby Award. An airline company is similar to an agency in terms of regulations, compliance, etc., but it must also engage customers to use its web services to book travel. Nothing prevents the government from contacting other industries to candidly discuss the method and the market that supports their products. In this space, the government is another consumer with similar challenges.

**Using a 3rd party to conduct market research**

When the government needs to make a strategic technology choice, such as selecting a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution, AI platform, open source alternative, or cloud platform, it’s often too complex to decide without deep technical research. By engaging with a third-party vendor to conduct the market research, you can significantly improve your decision-making by providing data that can help better inform acquisition strategies. An 8(a), GSA non-SOW schedule purchase, or a simplified acquisition, can give you a light-weight market research sprint acquisition to help a larger, more complex decision-making process. 

**What can this market research cover?**

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **1. Product and platform evaluation** | - Feature/functionality analysis <br>- Licensing and cost models <br>- Security posture (FedRAMP, SOC2, etc.) <br>- Performance and scalability <br>- Extensibility and vendor lock-in risks |
| **2. Real-life scenario testing** | - Use your agency’s real workflows or data (where possible). <br>- Simulate mission-critical use cases. <br>- Collect user feedback on the interface or performance. <br>- Conduct short pilots, sandboxes, or demos. |
| **3. Integrator ecosystem maturity** | - Assess the maturity of the services community around each product/platform. <br>- Consider: <br> • How many qualified integrators exist? <br> • What delivery models do they use? <br> • What is their experience in government contexts? <br> • Are they aligned to agile, modular delivery? <br> • Are they familiar with Section 508, FedRAMP, and the 21st Century IDEA Act? <br> • If Open Source, how involved is their community in the continual development of the tool? |

## Engaging the industry traditionally

The more “traditional” ways to engage with industry also have a place. These include pre-solicitation notices, draft RFPs, RFIs, pre-solicitation or pre-proposal conferences, and site visits. The Myth-Busting memo referred to at the beginning of this module offers the following suggestions on these topics:

* **Requests for Information (RFIs):** Issue an RFI to ensure the government understands the industry's capabilities and can develop or improve its acquisition strategy regarding contract type, performance requirements, performance work statements/statements of work, and performance metrics. Although not required, sometimes releasing a draft Request for Proposal (RFP), including sections L and M, ensures clear solicitation instructions. Get feedback from the industry on whether the evaluation instructions are clear or what could make them better performance indicators.  
* **Industry days:** Industry days are hosted by government agencies and offer a forum where vendors can learn more about pending procurements, identify potential partners and competitors, and interact and build relationships with government personnel. Such events can encourage competition and create a level playing field for all potential offerors. See the [ACT-IAC Report: Industry Day Best Practices for more guidelines on conducting an Industry Day](https://www.actiac.org/groups/document/industry-day-best-practices-white-paper-122014).

* **One-on-one communications:** As valuable as industry days can be, there are times when one-on-one communication may be more valuable. Vendors may be reluctant to expose their techniques or approaches to competitors. In private oral or written communications, the government can protect proprietary information and thus encourage vendors to share more.
* **Agency opportunity forecast:** Many agencies post advanced procurement plans and upcoming opportunities on their websites. Often, this includes a variety of background documents and information that the industry can use to understand better the agency's mission and specific acquisition needs well before specific individual actions. The industry can be given opportunities to respond and provide valuable feedback in crafting and refining requirements.

### Evolving market research for digital services

While they can still be used and are often required by acquisition strategy, traditional government RFIs often create unnecessary barriers for modern digital service providers. The burdensome processes can discourage the very vendors you want to engage, especially small, agile companies and non-traditional government vendors delivering high-quality tech services.

**Key concepts:**

* **Adapt to digital delivery realities:**  
  Digital services require flexibility, speed, and iteration. Forcing companies into rigid government templates or overly complex RFIs slows acquisitions and alienates top performers.

* **Streamline the approach:**  
  Don’t default to the RFI template. Align your market research format with the complexity of the solicitation. For simple needs, consider lighter-touch methods: video responses, virtual industry days, or facilitated roundtables.

* **Ask smarter questions:**  
  Avoid boilerplate checklists. Instead, ask about predictability in iterative delivery.  
  How does the company handle failure or pivots? Ask them to provide real examples of managing risk and client expectations.  
  Be wary of vendors claiming perfection, true partners acknowledge uncertainty and plan for it.

* **Watch for AI-filled answers:**  
  With AI now able to auto-fill generic responses, acquisition professionals must intentionally structure questions to reveal authentic capability, not just polished language. Use AI to support the process, but also be aware of overreliance. 

**Bottom Line:**  
Effective market research is about getting real insight, not compliance. Be thoughtful, be flexible, and design your research to surface true digital delivery capability, not just who can fill out the most forms.

### 3\. Explore other promising alternatives and approaches 

As the **Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)** continues to evolve, driven partly by new Executive Orders from the White House, procurement guidance is shifting toward a more flexible, modular approach. In this new era, we can expect to see more “ordering guides” and implementation policies that exist alongside, but are distinct from, the core statutes that must be followed. This creates a critical opportunity for acquisition professionals to think beyond rigid templates and embrace creative, compliant ways to conduct market research and shape solicitations. One powerful approach is to bring the vendor community into the early stages of requirement development and evaluation design. This method, used widely by other governments and increasingly piloted in the U.S., includes tools like open contracting workshops, prototype competitions via Challenge.gov, and collaborative drafting through platforms like GitHub. These practices help ensure solicitations are grounded in real-world capability and modern delivery approaches—before they’re even released.

**Open contracting standards in Canada and Europe**

Canada has been a pioneer in adopting open contracting principles. In 2014, it incorporated open contracting into its national action plan, leading to the publication of pilot datasets using the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS). The Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) is working towards implementing a Proactive Disclosure policy to provide timely and standardized open data on public contracting. Cities like Montreal have also begun publishing open contracting data, enhancing transparency and civic engagement.​

Europe, particularly the European Union (EU), has integrated open contracting into its procurement processes. The EU has aligned its eForms for public procurement notices with the OCDS to standardize data publication. Member states like Italy and Finland have received funding to implement OCDS in their contract registers, promoting transparency and efficiency in public procurement.​

**Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) open contracting approach**

The NMAAHC has embraced open contracting methods to enhance transparency and collaboration. For instance, in 2021, it issued a Request for Quote (RFQ) for Digital Archives Specialist services, detailing the scope of work, evaluation criteria, and performance periods. Additionally, the museum maintains a GitHub repository, promoting open access to its digital assets and encouraging community engagement in its projects. The NMAAHC sets a precedent for transparent and collaborative procurement processes in cultural institutions by leveraging platforms like GitHub and adhering to open contracting standards.

## Understand the cost-benefit and tradeoffs

When considering your market research approach, it's essential to consider not only what you want to learn but also what it costs the industry to answer your questions. Every time the government issues an RFI, hosts an industry day, or releases a draft solicitation, vendors must dedicate time and resources to responding. And for industry, time is money.

While large firms may absorb these costs as part of doing business, for small businesses, new entrants, and non-traditional vendors, this can be a significant burden, especially when the timelines to award stretch into months or even years. These costs show up in corporate overhead, impact pricing structures, and can deter companies from participating in future procurements altogether. In effect, overly burdensome market research doesn't just raise costs, it can shrink your vendor pool and reduce competition.

So how can we streamline? Start by asking:

* **Am I requesting anything duplicative?**
   Check if another agency has already done similar market research. Collaborate or borrow instead of duplicating effort. This helps reduce the government-wide burden on industry.
* **Can I learn what I need in a lighter-touch way?**  
   Instead of complex narratives or long-form white papers, use tools like brief surveys (even Google Forms), short video submissions, or structured Q\&A sessions.
* **Am I making the timeline clear?**
   Many companies leave when they realize that a procurement might take 12–18 months before contract award. Use your market research to set expectations and provide transparency around the process and timeline.
* **Does this question need to be answered by the vendor community?** 
   Sometimes, the data you seek already exists—in past awards, case studies, or government dashboards. Or it might be better answered by talking to a few experts rather than releasing a public RFI.
* **Can I reduce response friction?** 
   Keep submission instructions simple. Avoid requiring specialized formats, excessive page limits, or hard-to-follow templates. Be human-centered in how you request input.

Ultimately, every RFI or engagement comes at a cost to industry, especially for the small, diverse, and mission-driven companies we want to encourage. Being intentional and efficient with your approach isn't just good stewardship, it’s smart acquisition.

###  Scenario 1: The 60-page RFI that no one could answer

**Background**:  
 In 2023, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued [a Request for Information (RFI) for an Investigative Case Management (ICM) system](https://sam.gov/opp/7e20d6751a0e4a97be276139b8bcecad/view). The RFI was comprehensive, requesting detailed technical narratives, staffing plans, past performance examples, and pricing breakdowns—all within a tight 10-day turnaround. ​

Impact on industry:

* Small businesses and non-traditional vendors found it challenging to allocate resources to respond adequately within the given timeframe.​
* Several innovative companies unfamiliar with federal procurement processes were deterred by the complexity and depth of the information requested.​
* Only a few large integrators responded, many of whom repurposed content from previous submissions, offering limited innovation tailored to DHS's specific needs.​

Student Reflection Questions:

- Who is likely to respond to an RFI like this, and who is likely to opt out? Why?
- What assumptions did the agency make about vendor capacity and procurement timelines?
- How would this RFI affect your engagement decision if you were a small business?
- What information in this RFI might the agency have gathered more efficiently through other means (e.g., website reviews, past procurements, short vendor meetings)?
- What changes could have made this RFI more accessible while still gathering meaningful data?
- What downstream impacts could this RFI have on pricing, quality, and diversity of competition?
- What would a more human-centered or tech-aware version of this RFI look like?

**Result:**  
The agency received generic responses that didn't reflect the current state of the market or modern solutions. They missed out on input from more agile, cost-effective vendors. Moreover, the time and resources expended by vendors were eventually passed back to the government in the form of higher prices.​

**Lesson:**  
Instead of requesting extensive narratives and detailed pricing for undefined work, the agency could have hosted a focused industry listening session, followed by a simplified survey or form to gather essential information. This approach would have widened participation and provided a more accurate picture of market capabilities, reducing costs for all parties involved.

### Scenario 2: Open tech challenge yields better results

Background:  
 In 2010, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) launched [the Online Public Access (OPA) prototype](https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-35.html) as part of its Open Government Plan. Rather than issuing a traditional RFI and extensive Performance Work Statement (PWS), NARA engaged the public and developer community through collaborative platforms, including GitHub, to develop and refine the prototype. ​

Impact on industry:

* Numerous small and non-traditional vendors participated, including civic tech nonprofits and small commercial SaaS firms.​
* Companies invested in building real, working prototypes because the timeline was clear, and the cost of entry was low.​
* Without requiring formal submissions or GSA schedules, NARA gained direct insight into user experience, technical feasibility, and potential partners.​

Student Reflection Questions: 

* What barriers to entry were removed using an open challenge instead of a traditional RFI?
* How did the format of the engagement help uncover actual capability instead of marketing language?
* What risks did NARA take using this approach, and how were those risks managed or mitigated?
* How could this model be adapted for other types of federal procurements? What wouldn’t work in every context?
* How might non-traditional vendors perceive this process compared to a typical SAM.gov posting?
* What mechanisms allowed NARA to build trust with the vendor community before formal procurement began?
* What lessons from this approach could you bring into your next market research planning session?

**Result:**  
The winning concept came from a vendor who had never worked with the federal government before but offered a more modern and intuitive solution than legacy vendors. NARA was able to move quickly to refine its scope and run a targeted follow-on procurement that saved time and money.​

**Lesson:**  
By designing the market research around demonstration rather than documentation, NARA engaged a broader market and avoided the overhead costs (for both government and vendors) of traditional RFIs. They didn't just find vendors—they built relationships and trust in the process.​

These scenarios underscore the importance of thoughtful market research design. By considering the burdens placed on vendors, especially small and non-traditional ones, agencies can foster greater participation, encourage innovation, and ultimately procure more effective solutions.

## Conclusion 

### Applying human-centered design to market research in federal acquisition

Human-centered design (HCD) isn’t just for product development, it can (and should) be applied to the acquisition process, especially in the critical early stage of market research. We can build a more effective and inclusive buying process by centering the needs, behaviors, and constraints of the vendor community, procurement staff, and program stakeholders.

#### Start with empathy—even after the RFI closes

Most government RFIs go out with little follow-up or feedback once the window closes. But this is a missed opportunity for learning. Using HCD principles, we should treat RFIs as two-way engagements, not just data collection exercises.

Here’s how:

* Follow up with respondents to ask about their experience. What was easy? What was unclear? Did the questions help them understand what you need?  
* Reach out to companies you expected but didn’t hear from. Ask: Why didn’t they respond? Was it the timeline, format, unclear objectives, or something else?  
* These simple feedback loops help you understand what the market can do and how your processes shape who chooses to participate.

### Hold a retrospective with your procurement team

After every significant market research activity, bring your team together for a 15–30 minute retrospective using a simple "traffic light" format:
- Keep doing:
    - What worked well that we should repeat?
- Change or improve:
    - What felt clunky or unclear?
- Stop doing:
    - What created friction or added unnecessary burden?

This format helps normalize reflection and ensures everyone, contracting, program, and technical, can speak a common language. Applying digital service thinking to your acquisition approach builds internal trust, improves communication, and leads to better, more actionable outcomes.

## Leveraging AI to enhance productivity in federal market research

### Introduction: The challenge

As discussed, Federal acquisition professionals often face tight deadlines, complex regulations, and limited resources. Traditional market research methods, such as drafting RFIs, analyzing vendor responses, and preparing documentation, are time-consuming and labor-intensive. These processes can lead to delays in procurement cycles and increased workloads for already overburdened staff.​

### The solution: Integrating AI tools

Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools offer a transformative solution to streamline market research activities. By automating routine tasks, AI can free up valuable time, reduce errors, and enhance the quality of procurement decisions. 

Importantly, AI isn’t here to steal your job but to help you keep your sanity. Think of it as the junior contract specialist you’re training up: eager, fast, sometimes a little too confident, but ultimately helpful in handling the busy work you don’t have time for. You’re still the decision-maker, with the judgment, experience, and authority to guide the acquisition. The checks and balances of the procurement process still apply, and no AI tool is signing anything on your behalf. But if you need help sorting responses, drafting first-pass documents, or chasing down that one clause you can never remember, AI’s your overenthusiastic intern who *never* takes a lunch break.

**Key areas where AI enhances market research**

| Key Area | Traditional Approach | AI-Enhanced Approach | Time Savings |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **1. Drafting and reviewing documents** | Depending on their complexity, manually drafting RFIs, market research reports, and other procurement documents can take several hours to days.​ | AI tools like ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Gemini, or Claude can generate initial drafts of documents in minutes, which professionals can then review and customize.​ | Studies have shown that AI can reduce document drafting time by up to 80%, allowing staff to reallocate time to higher-value tasks. |
| **2. Analyzing vendor responses** | Reviewing and synthesizing responses from multiple vendors is a manual process that can take days, especially for large procurements.​ | AI can quickly analyze large volumes of text, identify key themes, and summarize vendor capabilities, facilitating, but not replacing, faster decision-making.​ | AI-assisted analysis can increase throughput by approximately 66%, significantly reducing the time required for comprehensive reviews. |
| **3. Conducting market research** | Gathering information on potential vendors and market capabilities often involves extensive manual research.​ | AI tools can aggregate and analyze data from various sources, providing insights into vendor performance, market trends, and potential risks.​ | Implementing AI in market research can improve productivity by up to 40%, enabling faster and more informed procurement decisions. |


### Top AI security \+ integrity considerations for acquisition professionals

| AI Risk | Details / Guidance |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Sensitive data can be exposed in public AI tools** | - Don't input proprietary, confidential, procurement-sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) into public AI tools (like free versions of ChatGPT or Bard).<br>- Some platforms use what you type to train their models, meaning your info could live on beyond your session.<br>- Use AI tools approved by your agency or ensure your tool has a “no data retention” policy or private model settings. |
| **2. Hallucinations are real (and annoying)** | - A hallucination is when AI confidently makes something up and passes it off as fact, like citing a non-existent FAR clause or policy.<br>- AI predicts plausible answers based on training data.<br>- Always verify AI-generated content, especially concerning regulations, law, or pricing. AI is a co-pilot, not a final authority. |
| **3. Model biases can skew results** | - AI reflects the data it was trained on, which may carry biases favoring certain vendors, tech solutions, or assumptions about “good performance.”<br>- Be mindful of potential bias in outputs; use AI for synthesis but maintain human judgment for fairness. |
| **4. Version drift and inconsistent output** | - AI tools change frequently; responses may vary day-to-day.<br>- Save outputs you plan to use; don’t assume you’ll get the same response twice. |
| **5. AI can reinforce bad inputs** | - Vague, incorrect, or biased prompts lead to poor outputs.<br>- Example: “Write a justification for this sole-source award” vs. “Assess if a sole-source justification aligns with FAR 6.302 guidance.”<br>- Prompt engineering matters: be clear, specific, and ask for sources. |
| **6. Output may not be audit-ready** | - AI drafts documents, summaries, and reports, but accuracy, compliance, and traceability remain your responsibility.<br>- Double-check final outputs; AI is a strong first-draft machine, not a compliance tool. |
| **7. Follow your agency’s IT and privacy policies** | - Agencies may have AI use policies governing tools, data input, and output handling.<br>- Check your agency's policy before using any AI tool or consult your IT/security lead. |


### Final thought:

AI can be like the world’s fastest intern, helpful but unreliable. You’re still the Contracting Officer, COR, or Specialist in charge. Use AI to speed up your work, but never let it replace your judgment.

Agencies need to understand what the market can provide to acquire the best digital service solutions they can afford. Appropriate communication with potential vendors is key to gaining this understanding. 

In this module, we’ve shown that pre-solicitation communication with vendors is not only allowed but desirable, and there are many different ways to engage with offerors effectively.

OMB has outlined [specific steps for obtaining and utilizing](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/memo/acquisition-360-improving-acquisition-process-timely-feedback-external-internal-stakeholders.pdf) employee and industry feedback regarding the acquisition process to continually motivate and encourage agencies to assess and improve vendor engagement practices. As you read, ask yourself what you can do as an individual acquisition professional to improve the pre-solicitation communication in your agency.

Finally, join the discussion below by responding to the following question (optional):

How do you see pre-solicitation communication as essential to acquiring digital services? Provide an example of a situation in which communicating with vendors before solicitation significantly impacted the outcome.
