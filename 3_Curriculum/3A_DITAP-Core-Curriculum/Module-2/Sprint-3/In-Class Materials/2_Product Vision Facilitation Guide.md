# Product Vision Facilitation Guide – Vision Questions

| Question | What’s the Ask | What to Listen For | How to Capture It |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **1. If this works well, what’s different for the user?** | What does success look like from the user’s perspective? What changes in their experience? | Concrete improvements in time, access, simplicity, and frustration levels | Write as: “Users can now [do X] without [pain point].” |
| **2. What do we want this tool or service to enable?** | What behavior, action, or outcome should this product make possible that isn’t possible now? | Outcomes, not just features (e.g., “apply easily” not “have a login form”) | Use active verbs: “Enables users to [action].” |
| **3. How does this help the agency deliver its mission?** | What’s the mission-level impact this product supports? How will this make the agency better at what it’s meant to do? | Connection to public service goals—speed, equity, access, cost savings | Frame as: “Supports mission by [how it contributes to the goal].” |
| **4. What’s a sign this product is working as intended?** | What observable signs, metrics, or behaviors would indicate success? | Measurable indicators like reduced drop-off, increased uptake, fewer calls for help | Capture as performance indicators or success criteria |
| **5. Who benefits the most from this product being successful?** | Which users or communities are most impacted if this product works well? | Equitable service outcomes (e.g., rural families, limited-English speakers) | Use this to inform accessibility, language support, or design considerations |
| **6. What’s broken today that this is meant to fix?** | Where is the current process's friction, duplication, confusion, or burden? | Problems tied to inefficiency, manual work, miscommunication, and error rates | Use these insights to reinforce the “why” behind the vision |
