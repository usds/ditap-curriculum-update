# Acq-A-thon Facilitation Toolkit for Contracting Officers

## What is an Acq-A-thon?

An *Acq-A-thon* is a collaborative workshop-style event designed to gather key stakeholders across the acquisition lifecycle to conduct discovery sessions that lead to smarter, better-informed acquisition strategies. Inspired by the concept of a *hackathon*—defined as an event in which a group of people come together to solve problems collaboratively, often through intense focus and teamwork (typically in coding or software design)—an Acq-A-thon shifts the focus to acquisition planning.

In an Acq-A-thon, teams work together in real time to:

* Define the problem and mission objectives

* Clarify product goals and vision

* Identify logistical, technical, legal, and budgetary constraints

* Sketch out early hypotheses for acquisition strategy

This is a shift from traditional acquisition planning methods, which often happen in silos through documents and workflows. Instead, Acq-A-thons encourage face-to-face communication, active participation, and shared understanding—ultimately de-risking the procurement and resulting contract.

## Purpose of an Acq-A-thon

To ask meaningful, strategic questions of acquisition lifecycle stakeholders that support the development of a strong acquisition strategy—one that leads to a contract capable of delivering on mission success. The Acq-A-thon fosters cross-functional alignment and reduces confusion, ambiguity, and preventable risk in schedule, performance, or budget.

## Who should be in the room?

**Must-Haves:**

* Program Office/Requirements Owner

* Contracting Officer

* Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)

* Product Owner (or person responsible for day-to-day delivery decisions)

**Should-Haves:**

* Budget/Finance Representative

* Office of General Counsel

* Information Security (CISSO)

* CIO/IT Representative (if the requirement is non-IT)

* Program/Division Leadership

---

## Outcomes of the Acq-A-thon

By the end of the event, you should have:

* A clear and collaboratively developed Problem Statement

* Defined Success Criteria (Return on Mission)

* A high-level Product Vision

* Identified Constraints (technical, budgetary, legal, operational)

* A draft Acquisition Hypothesis that outlines the initial path for market research and strategy development

---

## Facilitator guidance

* **Kick off with purpose.** Reiterate why everyone is in the room—shared clarity leads to shared accountability.

* **Set tone and norms.** Encourage candid discussion, and remind everyone that ambiguity and disagreement are natural parts of discovery.

* **Document in real time.** Use a shared digital whiteboard or notes doc to record decisions and assumptions.

* **Manage time.** Keep each session focused—if needed, create a “parking lot” for topics requiring deeper dives later.

* **Rotate roles (optional)**. Consider having someone besides the CO facilitate so they can fully participate.

---

## Final note

Remember: Acq-A-thons are about shifting the culture of acquisition planning from documentation to collaboration. Even a half-day version of this process is better than siloed, serial discovery. Invite people in, share decision-making early, and watch your strategies—and contracts—get stronger.

### Worksheet: Problem definition

Instructions: Define the real, user-centered problem to solve.

• Who is experiencing the problem and what is the impact?

• What happens if the problem is not addressed?

• What are the pain points or gaps in the current system or process?

• Avoid stating a pre-selected solution (e.g., 'We need a new system.').

Example: “Field staff rely on a legacy system that crashes often, causing delays in service delivery.”

### Worksheet: Product vision

Instructions: Describe the desired future state of the product or service.

• If this works well, what changes for the user?

• What should this product/service enable that isn’t possible now?

• How does this support the agency mission?

• What are signs the product is working as intended?

• Who benefits the most from its success?

### Worksheet: Return on mission

Instructions: Define public impact and mission-driven outcomes.

• How does this procurement help us serve the public better?

• What improvements in access, equity, or outcomes are expected?

• What would success look like in terms of public service impact?

• What are some measurable indicators or proxy metrics?

### Worksheet: Constraint discovery

Instructions: Use these prompts to uncover constraints that could impact the acquisition.

• **Budget & Funding**: Total available? Fiscal year? Obligation rules?

• **Security & Risk**: ATO needed? Known security requirements?

• **Internal vs. Contracted Expertise:** Who will lead day-to-day work? Is coaching needed?

• **Onboarding & Infrastructure:** Onboarding time? Credentialing issues? Remote access?

• **Business Process:** Is it a digital replica of current workflows or reengineered?

• **Contractual Requirements**: Set-aside rules? Certifications? Preferred vehicles?

• **Team Roles:** Is there a clear Product Owner or COR with capacity and authority?

• **Technical Environment:** System integrations needed? Cloud migrations?

### Worksheet: Acquisition hypothesis

Instructions: Draft the initial strategy to guide market research and planning.

• What is our best guess for the right contract type or structure?

• What acquisition methods or contract vehicles are most viable?

• What assumptions need to be tested through market research?

• What are possible risks or pivots if constraints cannot be addressed?
