## Overview & objectives

### Module summary

This module engages participants in a discovery process to set the foundation for informed acquisition strategy decisions. By assessing organizational maturity, identifying key stakeholders, analyzing mission and user needs, evaluating risks, and performing market research, learners will gather the data necessary to shape a successful digital service procurement.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Evaluate agency readiness and capacity for digital service procurement
- Identify and engage key stakeholders, distinguishing them from users and customers
- Define a digital service need and determine success criteria for the project and acquisition
- Analyze constraints that may impact acquisition outcomes
- Apply market research strategies to assess vendor capabilities for digital services

### Connection to overall DITAP program

This module supports the DITAP competency areas of assessing agency maturity and readiness, distinguishing stakeholders from users and customers, defining acquisition success, and doing effective market research. These skills enable learners to be deliberate and strategic in gaining support from stakeholders and to use specific measures to define success. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 1, and prepares learners for upcoming topics such as developing a strong acquisition strategy, preparing the solicitation, and useful evaluation methods. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing the foundational risk axioms for digital procurement, using a stakeholder power matrix, and developing effective market research skills.

### 4. Activity: Power matrix: Stakeholder mapping & power dynamics

Total time allocation: 15 minutes

#### **Activity instructions:**

- **Purpose**: To be able to think critically about stakeholders who have more potential to block or support their goals and how to plan for different scenarios:
  - Help participants identify and categorize stakeholders based on influence (power) and interest (engagement level) in a digital service initiative.
  - Introduce the power-interest matrix.
  - How might a high-influence, low-interest stakeholder impact your project?
- **Expected Outcomes**: Learners will have the tools to balance risk and power in a procurement scenario.
- **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):
  - Image of Power Matrix from slide deck
  - Example “Digital ID Pilot” case scenario
  - Short bios for the roleplay (below)
  - Whiteboard & markers or digital sharing interface
- **Instructions**  
    **Prompt**: “Now let’s bring our stakeholder knowledge to life with a mapping activity. You’ll use a simple matrix to think critically about who really holds power and who cares most about your initiative.”

**Share the case scenario** (e.g., "Digital ID Pilot")  
Imagine your agency is planning a pilot program for a secure digital ID system. The pilot will affect customer experience, internal access, and procurement systems.

Introduce 4–5 fictional characters (facilitator reads the roles and bios for each character):

**Characters: (read aloud)**

- **Gloria, the SES IT Director** – Approves funding, rarely attends meetings
- **Marcus, the Deputy CIO** – Cybersecurity watchdog, hesitant about pilot risks
- **Leila, a Program Analyst** – Works with the field teams; trusted voice
- **Alicia, the CX Lead Contractor** – Influential but external to agency hierarchy
- **Ben, the Procurement Specialist** – Likes consistency, risk-averse

**Explain matrix axes:**

- Influence = ability to accelerate or block progress
- Interest = how invested they are in the outcome

**Example prompt:**  
Imagine your agency is planning a pilot program for a secure digital ID system. The pilot will affect customer experience, internal access, and procurement systems.

- **Map** sample stakeholders from a fictional or real agency scenario.

**Prompts:**

- “Where would you place each person in the matrix?”
- “Who’s high interest, high influence?”
- “Who do you need to move?”
- **Bonus:** “How would their placement change over time?”

### 5. Optional role play activity: Stakeholder influence challenge

Total time allocation: 60 min

#### Activity instructions:

- **Time**: 60 min, in three rounds of 20 min each. Each round has 4 sections defined for this activity:
  - Prep (5 min)
  - Role play (5 min)
  - Debrief (5 min)
  - Transition (5 min)
- **Purpose**: Learners gain practice in influencing stakeholders in legal, governance, and leadership roles.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Learners will be able to develop strategies for navigating resistance and promote iterative, mission-aligned solutions when faced with bureaucratic challenges in the real world.
- **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):
  - [Stakeholder Influence Challenge role play activity & scenarios](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/15f6508bc695d51580b1672f39dadfc40c9fd534/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/In-Class-Materials/Role%20Play%20Activity_Stakeholder%20Influence%20Challenge.md)
  - Virtual or physical breakout rooms
  - Whiteboards and markers or digital sharing interface
- **Instructions**:  
    We will break into three groups of 3-6 people each for three, 20-minute rounds, rotating through roles in each round.

**Role bios:**

- **Role A:** Digital service or acquisition professional with a specific goal/request.
- **Role B:** A key stakeholder with decision-making authority who may resist the request (e.g., OGC Attorney, Procurement Executive, IT Governance Lead). Ideally played by a facilitator or guest actor.
- **Role C:** Observers and debrief leaders who evaluate the scenario and provide feedback on the influencing strategies used.

**Start the activity:**

- **Step 1: Break into groups**, 3-6 participants each.  

- **Step 2:** **Assign Roles**
      - Ask for a volunteer for Role A: "Hi everyone! We need a volunteer to play Role A—the person trying to influence a key decision maker. Once you go first, you get to observe future rounds. Who’s ready to step in?"
      - Assign Role B (can be a participant or a facilitator/guest actor).
      - The remaining participants become Role C (Observers).  

- **Step 3: Share the** [**Scenario**](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/15f6508bc695d51580b1672f39dadfc40c9fd534/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/In-Class-Materials/Role%20Play%20Activity_Stakeholder%20Influence%20Challenge.md#scenarios)
      - Share only the general scenario overview with all participants.
      - Do not share the specific role sheets for A or B with the full group.
      - If participants have trouble accessing the file, screen share or paste the text into chat.  

- **Step 4: Start the Prep Time (5 min)**
      - Use a visible or verbal timer.
      - Encourage camera off/mute for focused prep.  

- **Step 5:** **Run the Role Play (5 min)**
      - Ask Roles A and B to turn on cameras and begin.
      - Light facilitation is fine to prompt stuck participants.  

- **Step 6: Facilitate the Debrief (5 min, led by Role C)**

"Thank you, Role A and B. Now it's Role C's turn to guide the debrief. You observed the full conversation—what stood out?"

Provide or screen-share the following prompts:

- Debrief Prompts for Role C:
  - What was Role A’s ask?
  - What conflict did Role B introduce?
  - What strategies did Role A use to influence Role B?
  - What seemed effective or ineffective?
  - If you were Role A, what would you do differently?
  - How does this scenario reflect a real situation in your agency?
    
- Encourage peer discussion. Invite others in the group to build on responses.

- **Step 7: Transition (5 min):**
  - Return to main room.
  - Share key takeaways.

### 6. Using AI to translate vision into return on mission

Total time allocation: 23 min

#### Activity instructions:

- **Purpose**: Learn to generate a meaningful RoM and metrics with AI tools.
    - **Expected Outcomes**: Learners should better understand how to prompt AI tools to get meaningful results that support their RoM.
    - **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):
      - Divide groups in advance of the class
      - Access to an AI tool such as ChatGPT or Gemini
    - **Instructions**:
      - **Facilitator introduces (2-3 min)**  
            “In the private sector, ROI means profit. But in government, the true ‘return’ is mission impact. Today we’ll practice using AI to translate a product vision into something more meaningful—a Return on Mission and metrics that help us measure real outcomes.”
      - **Activity steps (10 min)**
          1. Split into small groups
          2. Start with a Product Vision
          3. Prompt the AI
          4. Review and Refine
          5. Capture the Output
      - **Discuss (10 min)**
          1. What stood out to you about how the AI described the mission impact?
          2. Did the metrics it generated feel relevant and actionable for a procurement?
          3. How might you improve the prompt to get better results?
          4. How can you use this type of exercise to accelerate collaboration with CORs or Program teams?
      - **Closing remark**  
            "When we center acquisition strategies around Return on Mission, we not only build better contracts—we build better outcomes for the people we serve."

| Facilitator themes to point out: |
|:----------------------------------|
| RoM is not fluff—it’s what helps justify strategy decisions to reviewers and stakeholders. |
| We want to move beyond compliance metrics and into public value and mission impact. |
| Provide talking points or examples to support these points. |
