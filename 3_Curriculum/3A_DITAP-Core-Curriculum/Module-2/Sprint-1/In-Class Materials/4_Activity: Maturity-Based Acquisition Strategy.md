## Facilitation Steps

**1\. Welcome & Learning Objectives (10 min)**
* Share the four learning objectives.  
* Icebreaker: “On a scale of 1–5, how mature do you think your agency is in digital service delivery—and why?”  
* Connect the document to current procurement challenges in the group.

**2\. Why Maturity Matters (10–15 min)**
* Walk through the section “Why Maturity Matters in Acquisition Strategy.”  
* Discussion prompt: “What are the consequences of overestimating organizational maturity in digital projects?”  
* Emphasize: Maturity ≠ agency size.

**3\. Foundational Risk Axioms (20 min)**
* Introduce each axiom using a mini-scenario:  
  * **Axiom 1:** Long contract stuck with underperforming vendor.  
  * **Axiom 2:** Proprietary system, can’t pivot vendors.  
  * **Axiom 3:** Misused fixed price in an unclear scope.  
  * **Axiom 4:** Frustration in agile adoption curve.  
* **Group exercise:** Match each axiom to a past challenge your team has experienced.

**4\. Whole-System Strategy Perspective (15–20 min)**
* Use the “Problem with One-Off Strategies” section.  
* Facilitate a discussion: “Which non-technical constraint—budget, staffing, culture, policy—has been the biggest barrier in your past procurements?”  
* **Tip: Use a fishbone diagram to map failures to root causes.**

**5\. Maturity Assessment & Strategy Matrix (20–30 min)**
* Provide an overview of digital maturity models.  
* Interactive activity:  
  * Distribute or project the TechFAR Hub or DSC maturity matrix.  
  * Have teams self-rate their current maturity.  
  * Discuss: “What types of acquisition approaches match where we are today—not where we wish we were?”  
* Key message: Matching strategy to current maturity reduces risk and improves outcomes.

**6\. Optional Deep Dive (30 min)**
* Walk through Maryland ADEPT case or a fictional scenario.  
* Prompt: “How would your strategy change if your maturity level was lower/higher?”  
* Use breakout groups if virtual or table teams if in person.

### Facilitation Tips

* Encourage honesty: maturity self-assessment only works if teams are candid.  
* Use real-life failures and successes to anchor the material.  
* Normalize that maturity-building is a journey, not a flaw.  
* Keep discussions time-boxed to ensure momentum.
