---

## Scenario 1: Problem definition & discovery

Your agency is launching a new initiative to enhance citizen interaction with government services. The program team is eager to implement a cutting-edge system and has already outlined several advanced features they believe are essential.

### Question 1
**As an acquisition professional, what is the best first step to ensure this initiative is successful and truly meets user needs, aligning with DITAP principles?**

| Option | Answer | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Immediately draft a Statement of Work (SOW) based on the proposed system features. | Incorrect | Drafting a Statement of Work (SOW) prematurely, especially with prescriptive features, risks defining the solution before fully understanding the underlying problem or user needs. DITAP emphasizes defining the problem first to avoid building the wrong thing. |
| B | Conduct a comprehensive market survey to identify available commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions. | Incorrect | While market research and exploring COTS solutions are crucial components of the discovery phase, this step should follow a clear understanding of the problem and user needs. Without that foundational understanding, market research might identify solutions for an ill-defined problem. |
| C | Engage with potential end-users and key stakeholders to understand their actual needs, pain points, and the problem to be solved. | Correct | This is the foundational first step in DITAP. It aligns with Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles and the U.S. Digital Service Playbook's first rule: "Understand what people need". By focusing on user needs and problem definition early, acquisition professionals prevent costly rework and ensure the solution is valuable. |
| D | Assess the agency's existing IT infrastructure to determine technical feasibility. | Incorrect | Understanding technical constraints and infrastructure is a vital part of defining an acquisition strategy. However, this comes after identifying the fundamental problem and user needs, as the solution's technical requirements should stem from those needs. |


---

### Question 2
**After initial discovery, your team has a clearer understanding of user needs for a new digital service. Your agency, however, has a history of being risk-averse when adopting new technologies, preferring established methods.**  

**How would you proceed with market research to build confidence and shape a realistic acquisition strategy that acknowledges your agency’s culture?**

| Option | Answer | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Solely rely on traditional Requests for Information (RFIs) to gather detailed vendor capabilities and minimize direct interaction. | Incorrect | Traditional RFIs can create unnecessary barriers for modern digital service providers, discouraging small, Agile, and non-traditional vendors whom you may want to engage. They may not fully capture innovative approaches or build the necessary trust for a risk-averse environment. |
| B | Conduct targeted market surveys and engagements including non-traditional vendors to showcase innovative, low-risk approaches, aligning with agency maturity and readiness. | Correct | DITAP emphasizes proactive and flexible market research, including using lighter-touch methods like surveys and engaging with non-traditional vendors to gain fresh insights. By demonstrating low-risk, innovative approaches, you can help shift the agency's perception of risk and align the strategy with its readiness for change. |
| C | Advise the program office to wait until agency leadership's risk appetite naturally increases before conducting any market research. | Incorrect | Delaying market research is counterproductive. Proactive market research is essential for informed decision-making and helps acquisition professionals identify strategies to address and potentially mitigate perceived risks, influencing leadership's perspective rather than passively waiting for it to change. |
| D | Select a well-known, large prime contractor from an existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) to reduce perceived risk. | Incorrect | While leveraging existing contracts can streamline procurement, defaulting to large prime contractors without specific market research might overlook more innovative, Agile, or cost-effective solutions offered by smaller or non-traditional vendors better suited for digital services. This approach may not align with the most appropriate solution for evolving digital needs. |

## Scenario 2: Acquisition strategy & solicitation

Your agency needs a new online portal that will serve a dynamic user base. Both user needs and the relevant policy environment are evolving rapidly, requiring continuous adaptation throughout the project's lifecycle.

### Question 1
**Given this dynamic environment and the need for flexibility and continuous adaptation, which acquisition strategy and contract type would best support this digital service procurement?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | A blended approach, such as T&M for discovery and/or FFP per iteration/modular contracting for development, provides flexibility while controlling risk. | Correct | This blended approach provides the necessary flexibility. A T&M contract can be valuable for uncertain discovery phases, allowing for exploration of requirements. Subsequently, FFP per iteration or modular contracting aligns with Agile delivery, maintains cost control, and reduces risk while preserving the agility needed to adapt to evolving scope and user feedback. |
| B | A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the entire project, with all requirements defined upfront. | Incorrect | An FFP contract with all requirements defined upfront is characteristic of a traditional waterfall approach. This rigid structure is generally not suitable for digital services where requirements and user needs are rapidly evolving and cannot be fully defined at the outset. |
| C | A traditional Cost-Reimbursement (CR) contract to cover all potential changes without strict cost controls. | Incorrect | While CR contracts offer flexibility, they place significant cost risk on the government due to a lack of strong cost controls. Furthermore, CR contracts are generally not allowed for commercial item procurements, which digital services often are. This option offers less cost predictability and can lead to overspending. |
| D | A single-award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to ensure a single vendor manages all evolving requirements. | Incorrect | While IDIQs offer flexibility for placing orders, a single-award limits competition and prevents the agency from leveraging multiple vendors for different modules or pivoting quickly if a single vendor underperforms. DITAP encourages multi-award vehicles to foster competition and reduce vendor lock-in. |


---

### Question 2
**You are tasked with developing evaluation criteria for this new digital service solicitation. The goal is to ensure vendors demonstrate genuine Agile capabilities and capacity for continuous delivery, rather than just strong proposal writing skills.**  

**What is the most effective approach to achieve this?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Focus heavily on written past performance references and detailed staffing plans. | Incorrect | While past performance (reliability) is important, it doesn't fully capture a vendor's Agile fluency or innovative execution. Detailed staffing plans can be prescriptive and might not reflect how an Agile team actually functions or adapts. |
| B | Implement a multi-phased "down-select" process that includes interactive evaluations like live demonstrations, code challenges, or solution walkthroughs. | Correct | This approach embodies the DITAP principle of "show, don't tell" in Agile acquisitions. Multi-phased evaluations with interactive elements allow the government to directly assess a vendor's actual capabilities, problem-solving skills, and Agile maturity in a realistic context, rather than relying solely on written proposals. |
| C | Require a comprehensive Statement of Work (SOW) from all offerors that prescribes the exact development methodology. | Incorrect | Prescribing the exact development methodology through a detailed SOW limits vendor innovation and contradicts the Agile emphasis on outcomes and adaptive processes. A Statement of Objectives (SOO) which focuses on desired outcomes is generally preferred for Agile procurements. |
| D | Prioritize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach to maximize competition. | Incorrect | While LPTA can promote competition, it focuses on meeting minimum requirements and does not incentivize innovative solutions or superior Agile capabilities. For complex digital services, a "best-value trade-off" approach is often more appropriate to balance price with critical non-price factors like technical merit and Agile fluency. |

### Optional - Question 3
**How should Contracting Officers address data rights and intellectual property (IP) in digital acquisitions to ensure long-term flexibility and reuse of solutions?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Assume the government automatically owns all rights to software developed under contract. | Incorrect | This is a common misconception. By default, contractors often retain certain rights unless negotiated. FAR Part 27 requires the government to specifically negotiate data rights; assuming automatic ownership may result in limited reuse and flexibility. |
| B | Negotiate appropriate data rights (e.g., Government Purpose Rights or Unlimited Rights) and include clear IP clauses in the solicitation and contract. | Correct | The best practice is to explicitly negotiate data rights and IP terms during acquisition planning. Securing Government Purpose Rights or Unlimited Rights ensures the government can reuse, share, and adapt solutions in the future without unnecessary vendor lock-in. |
| C | Avoid discussing data rights in the solicitation to speed up the acquisition process. | Incorrect | Avoiding IP discussions may lead to disputes post-award and can severely limit the government’s ability to scale, share, or modify solutions. Addressing IP upfront is essential for digital acquisitions. |
| D | Require vendors to transfer all proprietary rights to the government at no additional cost. | Incorrect | While this sounds appealing, vendors are unlikely to accept without higher costs. Overly aggressive IP demands can deter innovative vendors from competing. A balanced negotiation focused on government needs is more effective. |

## Scenario 3: Contract administration & performance

Your agency has just awarded a contract for Agile digital service development. As a Contracting Officer, your role extends beyond the award to ensuring the continuous success of the project and managing the vendor partnership effectively.  



### Question 1  
**As a Contracting Officer, how can you ensure continuous, effective government oversight and collaboration with the Product Owner (PO) and the vendor team after the contract is awarded?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Limit your involvement strictly to formal contract modifications and invoicing approvals. | Incorrect | This traditional approach is insufficient for Agile digital service contracts. DITAP emphasizes that a CO's role continues post-award, requiring ongoing involvement to support alignment, manage risks, and facilitate team coordination. |
| B | Require the vendor to submit weekly written status reports detailing all activities for your review. | Incorrect | Over-reliance on extensive written reports can lead to "waterfall" documentation habits and a focus on outputs rather than outcomes. While some reporting is necessary, DITAP promotes real-time transparency through working software demonstrations and direct team interactions over burdensome documentation. |
| C | Delegate all post-award oversight exclusively to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and intervene only if major problems arise. | Incorrect | While the COR plays a critical role in day-to-day oversight, the CO retains ultimate contractual authority. Effective Agile contract management requires active collaboration among the CO, COR, and PO to proactively identify and resolve issues, rather than waiting for critical failures. |
| D | Regularly attend Agile rituals such as Sprint Reviews and Monthly Business Reviews to observe progress, provide input, and address contractual matters. | Correct | Active participation in Agile rituals, particularly Sprint Reviews and Monthly Business Reviews, is crucial for continuous oversight in digital service contracts. This allows the CO to observe working software, assess delivery quality, address contractual barriers, and ensure alignment between the contract and the evolving project. |

### Question 2  
**The program office wants to ensure the new digital service continuously delivers value and improves user satisfaction, going beyond just meeting technical specifications. What types of performance metrics and incentive structures would best align with these overarching goals in an Agile context?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Focus on traditional Earned Value Management (EVM) and implement penalty clauses for missed deadlines. | Incorrect | EVM is a traditional project management metric that is generally less effective for Agile projects due to its focus on upfront detailed estimates rather than iterative delivery. Penalty clauses often incentivize minimum compliance rather than continuous improvement or high-quality user outcomes. |
| B | Require a detailed Project Management Plan (PMP) with adherence to every planned task as the primary metric. | Incorrect | A detailed PMP with strict adherence to planned tasks is characteristic of waterfall development, which struggles to accommodate evolving requirements. Agile emphasizes adaptability, meaning the plan can change based on new insights, making task adherence a less effective primary metric for value delivery. |
| C | Implement DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, Recovery Time) alongside user outcome metrics (e.g., user satisfaction, task completion) and value delivery incentives. | Correct | This comprehensive approach directly aligns with DITAP's emphasis on modern performance measurement. DORA metrics track key technical delivery aspects, while user outcome metrics directly measure the service's impact on users. Value delivery incentives (e.g., user adoption bonuses, performance improvement awards) motivate contractors to focus on actual mission outcomes and user satisfaction, promoting continuous value creation. |
| D | Use any contract type (e.g., T&M) without clear performance metrics. | Incorrect | The lack of performance metrics and incentives is the core issue, regardless of contract type. While T&M offers flexibility, using it without clear performance metrics or incentives places significant risk on the government, lacks accountability for value delivered, and provides no mechanism to ensure continuous improvement or user satisfaction. |

### Optional - Question 3  
**Which approach best ensures cybersecurity is continuously addressed in Agile digital services contracts?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | Rely solely on a one-time Authority to Operate (ATO) at project completion to confirm security compliance. | Incorrect | Waiting until project completion introduces risk of discovering vulnerabilities late in the lifecycle, when fixes are costlier and more disruptive. |
| B | Integrate DevSecOps practices and require continuous monitoring of security throughout development and delivery. | Correct | DITAP emphasizes modern practices such as DevSecOps, which embed security into every sprint and rely on continuous monitoring. This reduces risk by identifying vulnerabilities early and ensuring compliance throughout delivery. |
| C | Require vendors to submit an annual security plan update. | Incorrect | Annual updates are insufficient for Agile, iterative projects. Security threats evolve too quickly to rely on infrequent documentation updates. |
| D | Place sole responsibility for cybersecurity on the agency’s internal IT security office, separate from the vendor. | Incorrect | Security must be a shared responsibility. While the agency’s IT office plays a role, vendors must integrate security practices into their delivery for full coverage. |

## Scenario 4: Leading change & continuous improvement

You are a DITAP graduate enthusiastic about implementing modern acquisition practices in your agency. You propose introducing Agile-based contracts for upcoming IT modernization projects. However, your technical team has recently experienced significant IT failures that led to public scrutiny, making them highly risk-averse. They express strong resistance, stating, "That's not how things work here; we can't afford more risk."


### Question 1
**How should you best respond to overcome this resistance and advocate for modern acquisition approaches in this risk-averse environment?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Immediately present extensive data and examples from other agencies proving Agile's success, emphasizing your DITAP expertise. | Incorrect | While data and examples are valuable, leading with "expert power" can be perceived as dismissive and may alienate a team that is already defensive and lacking trust due to past failures. This approach might intensify their resistance rather than building rapport. |
| B | Withdraw your proposal entirely and wait for a more favorable time, as direct confrontation will likely be unproductive. | Incorrect | While patience is a virtue, completely withdrawing from the conversation or "biding your time" indefinitely is often a "cop-out" and prevents any progress. DITAP encourages finding ways to advance some change while maintaining relationships, even in challenging situations. |
| C | Insist on strictly following DITAP best practices, emphasizing your understanding of modern acquisition and the need for immediate, large-scale change. | Incorrect | Insisting on immediate, large-scale change without considering the team's current readiness, past trauma, or cultural context is likely to be met with strong resistance and could damage working relationships. DITAP advocates for meeting teams where they are and advancing change incrementally. |
| D | Acknowledge their concerns and past experiences, then propose a small, low-risk pilot task for an Agile approach, co-presented with a trusted colleague, to demonstrate the benefits incrementally. | Correct | This strategy aligns with DITAP's guidance on leading change, which is to: acknowledge fears (resistance often stems from fear), start small, and build trust incrementally. By framing it as a low-risk experiment and involving a trusted colleague, you reduce perceived threat and allow the team to experience the benefits firsthand. |

### Question 2
**As a DITAP graduate, you've gained valuable insights into modern acquisition practices, including Agile methodologies, user-centered design, and the importance of continuous improvement. You want to contribute to your agency's continuous learning and share lessons learned beyond your immediate team. What is the most effective way to contribute to this goal within the government context?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Regularly document your experiences (both successes and challenges) in practical guides or case studies, and actively share them internally or publicly (with appropriate agency approval). | Correct | DITAP strongly emphasizes that sharing "what worked—and what didn't" through formats like practical guides, short summaries, or case studies is a powerful way to turn individual experience into collective knowledge. This approach builds a culture of continuous improvement, promotes transparency, and helps others navigate similar challenges effectively. |
| B | Submit formal, lengthy reports to senior leadership summarizing all successful past acquisitions. | Incorrect | While reporting to leadership is important, formal, lengthy reports may not be the most effective way to share actionable lessons or foster a culture of continuous learning. They can be time-consuming to produce and may not be easily digestible or actionable for peers. DITAP advocates for practical, accessible formats. |
| C | Keep detailed personal notes of your experiences and apply lessons only to your own future procurements. | Incorrect | While personal reflection is valuable, keeping insights siloed limits knowledge transfer and prevents others from learning from your experiences. This hinders collective learning and the agency's overall continuous improvement. |
| D | Focus solely on attending external conferences and bringing back information for your team. | Incorrect | While learning from external sources is beneficial for staying current with trends, its impact is maximized when combined with internal application and the sharing of lessons derived from one's own practical work and experiences within the agency. It doesn't replace the need for internal knowledge capture and dissemination. |

---

### Optional - Question 3
**To reduce vendor lock-in and ensure continuity, which approach best supports knowledge transfer during vendor transition?**

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Allow vendors to keep proprietary processes undocumented to protect their competitive advantage. | Incorrect | This approach increases vendor lock-in and makes transitions costly and disruptive. Knowledge transfer is a critical component of sustainable acquisitions. |
| B | Require a detailed knowledge transfer and transition plan as part of the contract, including documentation, code repositories, and staff shadowing. | Correct | Proactively requiring knowledge transfer in contracts ensures continuity. Deliverables like documentation, open repositories, and shadowing reduce the risk of disruptions when transitioning vendors. |
| C | Plan to extend the incumbent vendor’s contract indefinitely to avoid transition risk. | Incorrect | Indefinite extensions increase dependency and risk of vendor lock-in, undermining competition and innovation. |
| D | Expect new vendors to “figure it out” during onboarding without requiring structured transition deliverables. | Incorrect | This often results in delays, rework, and loss of institutional knowledge. Transition should be planned and contractually required. |
