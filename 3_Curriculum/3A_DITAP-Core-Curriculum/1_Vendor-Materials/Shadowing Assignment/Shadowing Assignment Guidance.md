# Shadowing Assignment Guidance

## Overview

This guidance provides a high-level overview of the Shadowing Assignment for vendors responsible for delivering the DITAP program. It outlines expectations for facilitators, assignment structure, key deliverables, and guidance for ensuring a consistent learner experience.

The Shadowing Assignment requires participants to observe a digital services delivery team for at least four hours. The goal is to expose learners to modern practices such as agile workflows, user-centered design, and cross-functional collaboration in real-world settings. Vendors seeking shadowing opportunities shall first contact their respective agencies to identify appropriate points of contact; if additional support is required, contact the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS) for further assistance.


Example shadowing opportunities include:

- A team performing customer experience work at GSA’s Customer Experience Center of Excellence
- Attending backlog grooming and sprint planning sessions with a team at an agency
- Attending a private sector company’s sprint planning session. The goal is to expose learners to modern practices such as Agile workflows, user-centered design, and cross-functional collaboration in real-world settings.

### Recommended timeline & key milestones

- **Orientation:** Assignment introduced during live session
- **By the end of Module 2:** Participants submit shadowing proposal for approval
- **Throughout course:** Check in on progress, troubleshoot challenges
- **By penultimate class:** Participants complete shadowing and reflection submission

### Role of vendor & facilitators

Vendor organizations are responsible for ensuring their facilitators:

- Introduce the assignment clearly and on time
- Provide coaching on identifying appropriate teams to shadow
- Review and approve participant submissions using consistent criteria
- Offer support when participants encounter barriers to access. Normalize participant discomfort with outreach
- Offer a short in-class peer activity to brainstorm potential shadowing options
- Review and approve the final reflection deliverable
- Encourage post-experience in-class storytelling to reinforce learning

Vendors should equip their facilitation teams with:

- Access to example shadowing partners (optional)
- Templates for outreach or approvals (optional)
- A clear escalation process if learners cannot secure a shadowing opportunity

### Approval & evaluation criteria

Shadowing opportunity approval:

- The selected team is actively working on digital service delivery
- The proposal includes clear timing and description
- The experience totals a minimum of four hours

Final submission acceptance criteria:

- Summary is 2–3 pages and addresses core reflection questions
- Participant demonstrates understanding of digital practices observed
- Reflection includes observations on team dynamics, tools, blockers, and takeaways

### Sample language for facilitators

**Proposal is Approved [pass]:**  
"Your shadowing opportunity has been approved. Looking forward to your reflections after the experience."

**Proposal Needs Clarification:**  
"Can you clarify how this team relates to digital service delivery and confirm your proposed shadowing dates?"

**Final Submission Accepted [pass]:**  
"Your shadowing reflection has been received and approved. Well done."

**Final Submission Revision Needed:**  
"Thanks for submitting your reflection. Please expand on what you observed about team roles, challenges, or tools used during the experience."

### Escalation guidance

If a participant is unable to secure a shadowing experience by the Class 2 deadline:

- Encourage them to reach out to their peers
- Refer to a list of optional organizations (if your vendor uses one)
- Escalate to your internal program lead if additional support is needed

### Coordination & questions

Vendors should coordinate with their internal teams to ensure alignment on:

- Approval workflows
- Consistent messaging to participants
- Shared repositories of sample organizations or feedback templates (if applicable)

Thank you for ensuring a high-quality shadowing experience for all DITAP participants.
