# Digital Acquisition Case Study: Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges

Narrative Version of Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study

## The challenge

In government offices around the world, a quiet revolution is taking place. From London to Canberra to Singapore, agencies are abandoning their aging, creaking systems in favor of sleek, cloud-based solutions that promise to transform how they serve their citizens.

The United Kingdom's Home Office discovered this firsthand when it implemented cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, suddenly finding itself able to manage citizen interactions with unprecedented efficiency. Across the Pacific, Australia's Taxation Office experienced a similar transformation, using cloud-based CRM solutions to enhance customer service and streamline communication with taxpayers. Meanwhile, Singapore's Infocomm Media Development Authority embraced these same technologies to engage more effectively with businesses and the public, supporting their ambitious digital transformation initiatives.

The United States, never one to be left behind in technological advancement, has charted its own course toward this cloud-based future. In October 2018, the Office of Management and Budget released what would become known as the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy, or "Cloud Smart" – a cornerstone of the Federal government's IT Modernization effort. This initiative represents more than just a policy shift; it's a fundamental reimagining of how the federal government can harness cutting-edge technology to serve the American people better.

The Cloud Smart initiative carries with it ambitious goals: agencies must find ways to extend their current resources to maximize value, reskill and retain staff, and enhance security across all operations. The ultimate objective is to harness the power of emerging technologies that can expand each agency's capabilities and improve public service delivery.

Already, success stories are emerging. The General Services Administration has pioneered the use of Salesforce, a leading cloud-based CRM platform, to manage interactions with various stakeholders and dramatically improve service delivery. This early adoption has provided a roadmap for other agencies to follow.

Behind the scenes, the Chief Information Officers Council has been working closely with the OMB and the General Services Administration, along with other key agencies, to identify opportunities for optimizing cloud service usage across government. One of their most significant realizations has been the potential for Customer Relationship Management software to improve shared knowledge and collaboration across agencies.

The benefits of cloud-based systems are compelling: centralized access across distributed agencies and teams, streamlined data flows with consolidated information, and smoother, more intuitive service experiences for both government employees and the citizens they serve. However, beneath these promising outcomes lie significant challenges that cannot be ignored – security breaches that could expose sensitive government data, complex regulatory compliance requirements, and infrastructure challenges that could disrupt critical government operations.

The scope of such a system's impact would be vast, touching virtually every corner of government operations. Target users would span from budgeting specialists to contracting officers, from test and evaluation teams to logistics coordinators, from human resources personnel to countless others. Each group brings its own level of experience with digital tools, creating a complex web of varying technical proficiency and resistance to change.

Unlike the private sector, where a CEO can make an executive decision and implement it swiftly, the federal government requires an intricate dance of coordination and collaboration. The successful adoption of such a system demands the involvement of numerous key players and stakeholders: Contracting Officers who must navigate complex procurement regulations, Program Managers who must oversee implementation timelines, Information Technology specialists who must ensure technical compatibility, Compliance Officers who must verify regulatory adherence, and many others.

The challenges that complicate collaboration across these diverse stakeholders are as varied as they are significant. Communication barriers can emerge when technical specialists use jargon that business users don't understand. Risk assessment becomes a complex negotiation between competing priorities and perspectives. Cost considerations must balance immediate expenses against long-term benefits. Timelines and schedules must accommodate multiple departments with different operational rhythms. Performance expectations must be realistic yet ambitious. Defining requirements becomes an exercise in translating diverse needs into technical specifications. Even fundamental decisions about contract types and solicitation methods can become sources of disagreement.

Navigating these complexities requires more than just technical expertise – it demands an analytical mindset capable of considering numerous competing priorities and the varied needs of each stakeholder group. It requires diplomatic skills to build consensus among strong-willed professionals who are passionate about their respective areas of expertise.

## The players

### The players \- Part I

#### Acquisitions Office: Casey

The fluorescent lights hummed softly in the acquisitions office as Casey reviewed the assignment that had just landed on their desk. After more than a decade navigating the labyrinthine world of federal acquisitions, Casey had earned a reputation as the agency's go-to expert for acquiring cutting-edge software. The Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Level 3 certification hanging on the wall was more than just a credential – it was a testament to years of hard-won expertise in one of the government's most challenging fields.

But this assignment felt different. As Casey walked out of the meeting with agency leadership, a mixture of excitement and apprehension coursed through their thoughts. While Casey had successfully acquired numerous software solutions over the years, a cloud-based system like this CRM represented uncharted territory. The implications began cascading through Casey's mind like dominoes falling in sequence.

The agency's legacy systems were technological relics, some dating back decades, their original programmers long since retired. These systems were barely functional on their best days, yet they were so deeply embedded in agency operations that even the slightest modification could send ripples throughout the entire organization. The questions began forming, each one more complex than the last:

Who would be affected by this change? How could effective communication be established among all the diverse stakeholders who would have opinions about this acquisition? Would formal planning documents be necessary – a communication plan, a risk management plan, perhaps even a project charter? What concerns would other teams raise when they learned about this initiative?

Casey's experience with large IT acquisitions had taught valuable lessons about where to begin such complex endeavors. Coordination invariably started with two critical groups: the IT department, whose technical expertise would be essential for implementation, and the Compliance Officers, whose regulatory knowledge would be crucial for navigating federal acquisition requirements. Fortunately, Casey had cultivated strong relationships with both departments over the years, and several close colleagues in each group could serve as allies throughout this process.

Yet Casey understood that the challenges extended far beyond technical considerations. This project carried the potential for significant career impact – both positive and negative. Success would solidify Casey's reputation as the agency's premier specialist in complex software acquisitions, potentially opening doors to advancement opportunities and high-profile assignments. However, failure could attract the wrong kind of attention: congressional scrutiny, public criticism, and damage to the carefully built trust within the agency's political ecosystem. The government contracting world was unforgiving to those who stumbled on visible projects, and unsuccessful vendors had been known to lodge protests that could tie up acquisitions for months.

Recent training had emphasized the importance of empathy in stakeholder negotiations. The lesson was clear: each stakeholder needed to feel heard and understood throughout the decision-making process. This wasn't just good practice – it was essential for building the consensus necessary to move forward with such a complex acquisition.

#### The IT Department: Alex

In a different corner of the building, Alex was reviewing reports from the Chief Information Officers Council about progress toward the Cloud Smart initiative. The contrast with Alex's previous career in the private sector couldn't have been starker. There, innovation moved at lightning speed, unburdened by the layers of bureaucracy that seemed to define federal government operations. The transition to government work had required significant adjustment, but Alex had found purpose in the mission-driven environment, even if the pace of change sometimes felt glacial.

The Cloud Smart initiative represented both opportunity and challenge. While Alex was familiar with the concepts and potential benefits, adoption had been frustratingly slow across most agencies. Direct experience with integrating cloud-based systems into existing government infrastructure remained limited, leaving the IT department to navigate largely uncharted waters.

The theoretical benefits were clear enough – cloud-based solutions had become a priority for agencies across government. However, the reality of implementing these solutions within the agency's existing infrastructure would be nothing short of a logistical nightmare. The agency's legacy systems, some over twenty years old, had been designed in an era when cloud computing was the stuff of science fiction. Making these antiquated systems communicate effectively with modern cloud platforms would require careful planning, significant resources, and more than a bit of creativity.

To prepare for the inevitable challenges, Alex and the IT team had conducted preliminary research into the implications of cloud-based system implementation. However, these findings had not been shared widely, partly due to the preliminary nature of the analysis and partly due to uncertainty about how other departments might react to the technical challenges that had been identified.

Beyond the technical hurdles lay an even more formidable obstacle: the human element. Alex had witnessed firsthand the resistance that often accompanied new system implementations. The agency employed numerous career government workers who had built their professional identities around mastering existing systems and processes. These employees usually viewed change with suspicion, if not outright hostility. Training staff on new software was just the beginning – ensuring universal adoption and maintaining consistent, quality usage represented ongoing challenges that could persist for years.

The phrase "This is the way we've always done it" had become an unofficial motto among certain segments of the workforce. Alex heard it regularly when discussing new initiatives or proposing system improvements. This cultural resistance to change represented a significant barrier that technical solutions alone could not overcome.

#### The interaction \- Acquisitions Office and IT

Casey's first strategic move was a meeting with Alex, the IT department's respected leader. Their professional relationship had been built over numerous successful acquisitions, creating a foundation of mutual respect and shared accomplishments. However, when Casey broached the topic of the cloud-based CRM acquisition, Alex's usually enthusiastic response was noticeably more measured.

"We've been doing some initial research," Alex began, settling back thoughtfully in the conference room chair. "The truth is, this cloud solution could create some significant challenges for us. Our legacy systems are over two decades old – some of them are older than that. Getting them to communicate effectively with cloud-based platforms without causing major disruptions isn't going to be easy."

Casey listened intently, recognizing the validity of Alex's technical concerns. But Alex wasn't finished. "The real challenge isn't just technical, though. It's the human element that's going to give us the most trouble. We've got career employees who fundamentally resist change. They're going to fight this at every step of the process."

Casey nodded, recalling the undercurrent of discontent that seemed to accompany every new initiative introduced within the agency. However, the conversation was revealing something deeper than individual resistance – it was exposing a cultural reluctance to embrace change that went beyond technical concerns.

Alex continued, "Our experience with cloud-based software adoption has been pretty limited so far. The Cloud Smart initiative is still relatively new, and most agencies haven't progressed very far into the actual acquisition and implementation phases. That means we're somewhat in uncharted territory here."

Then Alex offered a potentially helpful resource: "I keep thinking about the integration challenges we're facing, but there has been some recent movement that might help. The Information Technology Category and Cloud Solutions Category Teams have been collaborating with the OMB to centralize information about cloud initiatives and procurement resources. They've established the Cloud Information Center, which has specifically outlined guidance for acquisitions. That might be a good starting point for additional information about how this affects our project."

The conversation took a decisive turn when Alex broached the subject of compliance review. "We're definitely going to need to bring Compliance into these discussions. We won't make much progress without their input. The good news is that we work closely with them regularly, so I know how to approach this. It might be more efficient if I meet with the Compliance Officer directly first. We can usually reach consensus on technical matters pretty easily. I'll report back to you with our joint recommendations."

Casey felt a flicker of concern about being excluded from these initial discussions between IT and Compliance, but ultimately trusted the professional relationship that had been built over years of successful collaboration. Alex's track record of thorough analysis and due diligence provided reassurance that essential details wouldn't be overlooked.

### The players \- Part II

#### Compliance Office: Riley

In the compliance office, Riley was immersed in the detailed review that had become second nature over nearly two decades of federal service. As a seasoned Compliance Officer, Riley had recently been selected for the prestigious Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program – a clear indication that promotion to a senior leadership position was not just possible, but probable. The recognition represented the culmination of years of successful team leadership and project management while serving as a GS-15 within the agency.

Riley's current supervisor had been instrumental in this professional development, and their continued mentorship would prove valuable throughout the CRM acquisition process. The relationship provided both guidance and advocacy as Riley navigated increasingly complex regulatory challenges.

The primary responsibility of examining, evaluating, and investigating whether projects and systems complied with federal laws and regulations had earned Riley and other Compliance Officers a somewhat unfortunate reputation. Different teams often viewed them as barriers to progress, the people who specialized in explaining why proposed initiatives couldn't be implemented as planned. The informal designation as "government watchdog" wasn't always meant as a compliment, but Riley had learned to wear it with professional pride.

Each day brought new challenges as Riley reviewed various elements of the Federal Acquisition Regulations system, ensuring that proposed acquisitions aligned with complex regulatory requirements. The work required meticulous attention to detail and a comprehensive understanding of evolving federal procurement law.

As the government's focus shifted toward system modernization, Riley had noticed that reviews and audits increasingly centered on cybersecurity issues and data security concerns. These topics had become not just important, but absolutely critical to the agency's mission and public trust.

#### The interaction \- IT and the Compliance Office

Riley's calendar notification chimed with a meeting request from Alex to discuss a cloud-computing software acquisition. Cloud computing had been on Riley's professional radar since the Cloud Smart initiative's launch several years earlier, representing both significant opportunities and substantial risks.

From a security perspective, Riley and other Compliance Officers had been encouraging agencies to adopt a risk-based approach when evaluating cloud solutions. A recent report to the President had made clear that agencies should emphasize "data-level protections and fully leverage modern virtualized technologies." For Compliance Officers, protecting sensitive government data represented the highest priority, particularly when considering cloud-based solutions that would store and process information outside traditional government-controlled environments.

Riley felt relieved that Alex had initiated these discussions early in the acquisition process. Experience had taught that the most effective way to minimize risk was through open communication and collaboration with IT teams during the planning phases, before implementation and infrastructure decisions became locked in.

When the meeting convened, Alex shared the IT department's concerns about system integration challenges. Riley's response reflected hard-won experience from observing other agencies' attempts at cloud adoption: "The problem we've encountered is that some agencies have rushed through the cloud acquisition process and ended up with serious compliance violations. We've seen contracts mishandled, data security compromised, and vendors failing to meet federal standards."

These concerns weren't theoretical – they were based on documented failures at other agencies. However, Riley also understood that these problems could be avoided with proper planning and execution.

For Riley, certain issues were non-negotiable: compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations and ensuring robust data security. One particularly significant challenge involved the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which required comprehensive security reviews to ensure that vendors met stringent federal security requirements. Moving too quickly through any of these regulatory processes created unacceptable risks for potential security breaches and privacy violations – the kind of problems that attracted unwanted attention from oversight bodies.

"I absolutely agree that agencies need to start adopting these cloud solutions," Riley emphasized, "but honestly, the security risks have me on high alert." Over the following series of meetings, Riley and Alex explored various potential solutions, but none seemed to address both parties' core concerns adequately.

Eventually, Alex reported back to Casey: "We've been working through several different approaches, but this is proving more complex than usual. We're having difficulty reaching consensus on a single path forward."

Casey recognized an opportunity to apply negotiation and relationship-building skills that could benefit these ongoing discussions. The proposal for an Integrated Project Team represented a structured approach to the challenge. "I think an IPT could really help here," Casey suggested. "These teams provide a more holistic approach to project management, allowing representatives from different functional areas to work together effectively throughout the entire project lifecycle."

Casey understood the potential drawbacks – IPTs could be challenging to manage due to the diverse backgrounds of team members and the consensus-building requirements that could slow decision-making. However, the benefits seemed to outweigh these challenges. "I really believe I can contribute here. If the three of us work together, I can better understand the root causes of these issues and assess their potential impact on any solution we develop."

#### The Interaction \- Acquisitions Office, IT, and Compliance Office

The joint working sessions that followed represented a new phase in the acquisition process. Casey began by asking Alex and Riley to articulate the significant challenges that the acquisition presented clearly.

Alex spoke first, outlining the technical and operational challenges: "We're looking at potentially major disruptions to agency operations. We have two options: update our legacy systems, which would require months of intensive work, or risk serious operational downtime during the transition to the new cloud system. Any solution that requires custom integration work means my team will be stretched beyond capacity. They all have existing responsibilities that can't be ignored. Plus, they're the ones who will have to deal directly with user resistance and training challenges."

Riley added a compliance perspective: "With proper planning, testing, and cross-departmental coordination, these challenges can be managed effectively. However, we would need to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for successful implementation. The prospect of updating legacy systems to meet cloud system requirements raises significant concerns about maintaining regulatory compliance. Any newly developed solutions would require thorough compliance reviews, updated risk management policies, and additional implementation strategies."

Alex's expression showed disagreement with this assessment. "But updating legacy systems might actually reduce complications because those tools have already been audited and approved through our existing processes."

Riley continued, "From a security standpoint, whether we choose to update legacy systems or develop new custom integrations, data security remains a critical concern. Either option would require regular security audits and system updates to protect our infrastructure. This creates serious implications for time allocation, resource management, and potential operational disruptions. What about developing and implementing advanced encryption and access controls?"

"That approach might help prevent security threats," Alex responded, "but encryption would significantly slow system performance. We're talking about increased latency, additional storage requirements, and potential performance crashes. My team would be responsible for managing all of these issues, and we simply can't absorb those kinds of operational hits."

The fundamental tension became clear: both Alex and Riley believed their respective concerns should be the primary drivers of the decision-making process.

## Potential pathways for solution development

As weeks passed, the underlying tension between Alex and Riley continued to simmer beneath the surface of their professional discussions. Both departments remained convinced that their priorities should shape the final decision. However, Casey's steady leadership began guiding the group toward potential middle ground solutions.

Working collaboratively, the team identified two primary challenge areas, each with two potential solution approaches:

### Integration issues

**Solution A: Develop custom Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to integrate the CRM with existing legacy systems.** This approach would provide a tailored solution specifically designed for the agency's unique technical environment. However, it would involve significantly higher costs and extended development timelines compared to alternatives.

**Solution B: Upgrade legacy systems to improve CRM compatibility.** This path would simplify the integration process by modernizing existing systems to work more effectively with cloud-based platforms. However, it requires substantial upfront investment and could disrupt ongoing operations during the upgrade process.

### Data security concerns

**Solution A: Implement advanced encryption and access controls.** This approach would ensure the strongest possible protection for sensitive government data. However, it could negatively impact system performance, potentially affecting user experience and operational efficiency.

**Solution B: Conduct regular security audits and updates.** This strategy would maintain appropriate data protection standards while minimizing immediate impacts on system performance. However, it would require ongoing resource allocation and sustained attention from both IT and compliance teams.

## Data and evidence

With these solution frameworks in mind, Casey conducted comprehensive research using industry white papers and reports, case studies, vendor documentation, academic papers, and IT cost management studies. The research revealed critical quantitative and qualitative data points:

**Quantitative findings:** Custom APIs would cost approximately 20% more and require 30% longer implementation timelines compared to system upgrades. Advanced encryption could add as much as 15% performance overhead to system operations, while regular security audits would necessitate additional staffing and resource allocation.

**Qualitative insights:** The IT department's analysis suggested that custom APIs would provide superior long-term stability despite higher initial costs. Compliance officers emphasized that advanced encryption was essential for meeting federal data protection requirements, while regular audits were easier to manage operationally but required sustained attention and resources over time.

These research findings would prove crucial as the team worked toward developing a comprehensive solution that balanced technical feasibility, regulatory compliance, cost considerations, and operational efficiency – all while maintaining the collaborative relationships that would be essential for successful implementation.
