# Introduction to the Threaded Case Study
Throughout the DITAP curriculum, we incorporate the Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study. Unlike standalone activities, this scenario runs across modules and evolves with the program. It gives learners the opportunity to apply the DITAP frameworks in realistic situations, and to see how early decisions ripple into later stages. This continual experience helps them connect their learning to situations, obstacles, and requirements that may happen in their actual jobs. Our introduction video below goes into more specific detail on implementing the case study and provides some helpful connection points.
