# Stakeholder Interview Guide Template

## Instructions

This template can serve as a starting point to populate protocols and questions for key stakeholders you’ll engage with in your agency. You can use it with the Stakeholder Interests Template to help you prepare for stakeholder interviews.

We’ve populated a few sample interviews and questions to help you get started. Remember that stakeholder interests and concerns vary widely depending on the type of procurement, what’s common practice in your agency, what you may be asking the agency to do, and the stage in the acquisition lifecycle.

As you continue to grow and learn more about digital services acquisition, you can use your experiences to add to and refine these resources so they remain useful in future projects.
