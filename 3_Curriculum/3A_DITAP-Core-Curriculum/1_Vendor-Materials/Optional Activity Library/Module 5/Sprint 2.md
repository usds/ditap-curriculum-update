### Activity – AI Coaching: Staying Current in Procurement Technology  
Use an AI chatbot to explore how you can stay up to date with shifts in digital services and procurement. Share your role and context, and see what insights it generates. For example, you might use a prompt like this:  

> Act as a digital acquisition trends analyst. I work in federal procurement and want to stay ahead of emerging tools, regulations, and market shifts relevant to digital services. Based on the latest available information, identify 5–10 developments I should track over the next year, explain why they matter for acquisition work, and suggest a short action I can take each month to deepen my understanding. Prioritize credible sources, recent examples, and relevance to FAR-governed environments. Include one or two examples from a source outside the federal government.
