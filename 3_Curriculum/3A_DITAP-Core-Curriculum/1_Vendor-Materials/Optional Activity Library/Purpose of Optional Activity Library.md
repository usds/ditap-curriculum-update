# Optional Activity Library - Purpose
This library offers facilitators a collection of extra activities to enrich live sessions. Suggested during course design, these activities align with the learning objectives and key topics for each module. Some are fully developed and ready to use, while others are provided as ideas that may require adaptation or additional preparation.

The purpose of this library is to give facilitators flexibility and choice. You can draw from these activities to:

- Reinforce or extend key concepts introduced in the self-paced modules.  
- Encourage discussion, reflection, and application of ideas to real-world contexts.  
- Provide variety in session formats and learner engagement strategies.  

Feel free to modify, combine, or build on these activities to best suit your learners and context.
