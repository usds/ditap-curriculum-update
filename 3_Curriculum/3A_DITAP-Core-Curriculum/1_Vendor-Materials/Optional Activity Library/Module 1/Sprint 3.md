# Module 1 Sprint 3

## Content Topic: Tech Topic: Data  

### Activity – Contract Data Timeline
Students build a timeline of a sample contract’s lifecycle, data generated at each stage, and who might use it years later.  
Then ask: *What data needs to be kept forever? What might we archive? What could be deleted?*  

### Activity – Vendor Data Drill
Provide sample RFPs or procurement requirements involving AI, analytics, or cloud services.  
Ask: *What should a CO ask about how vendors store, access, or use data?*  
**Bonus:** Build a checklist of good questions.  

### Activity – System Map Building
Groups sketch a flow of data across a procurement system, from solicitation to closeout.  
Identify bottlenecks, risk points, and opportunities for modernization.  
Tools: whiteboards, Miro, or sticky notes.

## Content Topic: Tech Topic: Software  

### Activity – Discussion Prompts
- Describe in your own words what software is. Why is understanding this important for a contracting officer?  
- How do external packages or libraries affect the security and procurement of government software?  
- Discuss the balance between frequent software updates and maintaining stable, secure systems.  
- Why are monitoring and observability critical post-deployment? What could happen without adequate monitoring?  
- Why are accessibility standards (Section 508 compliance) critical in government procurement?  
- How can ongoing user feedback and analytics drive better procurement outcomes? How can they make procurement processes harder to manage?  

### Activity – Contract Drafting Relay (A Git-Inspired Paper Exercise)
- **Setup:** Each group works on the same “contract” document with multiple clauses.  
- **Step 1:** Start with a common base contract (the main branch).  
- **Step 2:** Assign each group to work on a different clause (like a feature branch).  
- **Step 3:** After a few minutes, each group reports what they changed and “merges” their edits back into the main contract.  
- **Step 4:** Introduce intentional conflicts (e.g., two groups edit the same clause differently) and walk through how to resolve them.

## Content Topic: Tech Topic: Cloud  

### Activity – Discussion Prompts
- What is cloud computing? Why use “the cloud”?  
- How is cloud computing different from traditional data centers?  
- How is cloud cost management different from traditional data centers?  
- Is the cloud more or less secure than a traditional data center?  
- Does using cloud computing promote vendor lock-in?  

### Activity – "Cloud Jeopardy!" – Interactive Knowledge Challenge
**Objective:** Test and reinforce foundational knowledge about cloud computing in a fun and competitive format.  
**Time:** 60 minutes  
**Format:** Large group, split into teams  
**Materials:** Digital or physical Jeopardy-style game board (JeopardyLabs, PowerPoint, etc.)  

**Categories:** Cloud Basics, FedRAMP, Cost Models, Security & Compliance, Contract Clauses  

**Steps:**  
1. **Team Formation (5 min):** Divide participants into 3–4 teams.  
2. **Gameplay (40 min):** Teams take turns selecting questions. Correct answers earn points; incorrect answers can be stolen.  
3. **Final Cloud Round (15 min):** Each team wagers points and answers a scenario-based question (e.g., *“A vendor proposes a hybrid cloud solution that doesn’t align with current security protocols—what do you do?”*).  


### Activity – "Cloud Contract Critique Lab" – Group Breakout
**Objective:** Develop critical thinking skills by analyzing real or simulated cloud contract excerpts.  
**Time:** 75 minutes  
**Format:** Pairs or small groups  
**Materials:** Sample cloud service contracts (redacted or mock), analysis rubric or worksheet  

**Steps:**  
1. **Introduction (10 min):** Overview of common cloud contract pitfalls and key elements.  
2. **Review & Annotate (30 min):** Groups read and mark up the sample contracts using the rubric.  
3. **Group Report Out (20 min):** Each group presents one red flag and how they would address it.  
4. **Wrap-Up (15 min):** Facilitator summarizes issues, best practices, and resources.

## Content Topic: Tech Topic: Artificial Intelligence  

### Activity – Discussion Prompts
- Can anyone think of a time when a tool made a suggestion that didn’t feel quite right? How might that apply to AI in procurement?  

### Activity – AI in the GovCon Wild
Review actual solicitations or tech contracts (e.g., AI-enabled fraud detection tools, automated document summarizers). Discuss:  
- What the AI is doing  
- What challenges/questions they’d have about the requirement  
- What performance/oversight issues they’d flag  

### Activity – AI Buzzword Bingo
Create cards with AI terms like *training data, black box, chatbot, bias mitigation.* As learners review mock proposals, they mark terms as they appear and discuss their meaning.  

### Activity – Explain This!
Learners role-play responding to a FOIA or audit request related to an AI decision. What would they need to document or explain?

## Content Topic: Tech Topic: Cybersecurity  

### Activity – Discussion Prompts
- How do you know if your digital system is secure?  
- What are some of the key federal security standards for Federal Civilian digital systems?  
- What’s the difference between Cybersecurity Governance & Compliance, and Cybersecurity Operations?  
- Is it possible to perfectly secure a digital system so no cybersecurity incident can ever happen?  
- What is the role of CISA in U.S. cybersecurity?  
- Why is implementing Zero Trust important?  

### Activity – Cyber Risk Walkthrough: Procurement Scenario Simulation
**Objective:** Help participants identify and assess cybersecurity risks during the procurement lifecycle.  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Materials:** Scenario handouts, FAR clause reference sheets, whiteboard  

**Steps:**  
1. Present a detailed solicitation draft with embedded red flags.  
2. Teams analyze the document and identify potential cybersecurity risks.  
3. Each team presents findings and suggests contract language, FAR clauses (e.g., FAR 52.204-21 or 52.239-1), or evaluation criteria to mitigate risks.  
4. Debrief as a group to discuss best practices and lessons learned.  


### Activity – "Cyber Clause Combat": Interactive Policy Matching Game
**Objective:** Reinforce knowledge of key cybersecurity clauses, policies, and frameworks in procurement.  
**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Materials:** Game cards, timer, leaderboard display  

**Overview:** A fast-paced matching game where participants pair procurement scenarios with the correct cybersecurity clauses or policy references (e.g., CMMC, NIST, DFARS, FISMA).  

**Steps:**  
- Participants receive cards with procurement events/issues (e.g., *Handling CUI*, *Cloud service acquisition*).  
- Other cards contain cybersecurity standards, requirements, or clauses.  
- In small groups or pairs, participants race to match scenarios with the correct references.  
- Points awarded for speed and accuracy.
