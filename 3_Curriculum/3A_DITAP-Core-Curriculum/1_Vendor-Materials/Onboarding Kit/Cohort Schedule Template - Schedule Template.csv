"Program Calendar Notes:
1. Successful completion of the DITAP Program and certification, require that each participant complete 100% of course materials, assignments and discussion questions.
2. Optional virtual office hours should be offered on a bi-weekly basis.
3. This schedule isn't meant to be rigid; it's a suggested timeline for course completion. You can edit it as you need.
4. We strongly encourage participants to complete instructor-led webinars in real time. Recordings should be available for make-up sessions.",,,,,,,,,,
