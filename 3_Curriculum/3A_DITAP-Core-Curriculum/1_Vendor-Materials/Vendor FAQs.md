# Vendor FAQs

Q. Will pre- and post-assessments use the same questions for comparative measurement?

>A. The pre- and post-assessments do not use identical questions, but they are designed to be comparable. The Pre-Assessment surfaces baseline understanding and confidence with DITAP tools and frameworks, helping facilitators anticipate learner needs and tailor early instruction. The Post-Assessment captures growth in conceptual fluency, confidence, and applied decision-making, giving participants a clear view of their progress. Baseline assessments are provided, and vendors may amend scenarios or questions, but they must ensure consistent administration across cohorts for reliable comparisons.

Q. Will module-level (formerly release-level) assessments be updated?  
>A. End-of-module assessments are at vendor discretion, but knowledge checks and applied assignments embedded in modules are a required part of assessing conceptual fluency (See: Vendor Playbook \- Assessments \- Vendor Assessment Requirements Summary). Vendors may update or supplement these as long as they reinforce module objectives and align with the core assessment areas.

---

Q. Will there be a consistent point system (e.g., \~1000 total points, 70% passing threshold)? 
>A. The DITAP program uses a pass/fail structure rather than a point system. This approach emphasizes meaningful growth, collaboration, and real world application, helping learners build lasting competency with less performance anxiety.

---

Q. How will the approach to assessments affect vendor tracking of learner performance and outcome equivalency?
>A. Vendors must track participation, conceptual fluency, and capstone performance using the rubrics and formative/summative assessments outlined in the Assessments section of the Vendor Playbook. While implementation details may vary, the use of consistent rubrics (See: Vendor Playbook \- Assessments \- Participation and Conceptual Fluency) and structured capstone deliverables ensures outcome equivalency across cohorts, in accordance with the Vendor Assessment Requirements Summary outlined in the Vendor Playbook.

Q. How will program duration (3 vs. 6 months) affect CLP eligibility (e.g., 60 vs. 80 CLPs)?
>A. Participants in the full 6-month program continue to be eligible for 80 CLPs, the same as in the previous program. For shorter or adapted versions, training providers must work with USDS to determine the appropriate CLP allocation. Clear criteria should be communicated in course materials to ensure learners understand the difference.

---

Q. Should curriculum materials be publicly available if vendor eligibility is limited? 
>A. USDS is making the curriculum open source as it believes sharing this information with as wide an audience as possible is in everyoneâ€™s best interests. However, making the curriculum open source does not impact which vendors are authorized to deliver the training. 

---

Q. Could students access assessments or answers through GitHub, compromising instructional integrity?  
>A. DITAP assessments are experiential in nature, focusing on applied learning, case-based assignments, and real-world decision-making rather than rote memorization; the risk of compromising instructional integrity is lower than in traditional assessment models. Knowledge checks and capstone assignments are designed to reinforce practice and application, not to be memorized. Still, vendors should protect assessment materials where possible to preserve fairness and instructional value.

Q. Some vendors have experienced difficulties with the SCORM files in Canvas and Moodle, for example, the content looked "broken" when uploaded. They also found places where they are not passing accessibility tests; the tab order did not perform properly when tested. 
>A. We understand how important it is that the SCORM exports function across different LMSs while also meeting accessibility requirements.
<
>Here is what our team recommends as next steps.
>
> * **Engage LiaScript developers**: Since the accessibility issue appears to be rooted in LiaScript itself (rather than Canvas or the SCORM package), the most direct path may be to raise this with the LiaScript developers. You can open a support issue at this link with LiaScript. We have reached out proactively to our LiaScript contact to let them know this request is likely incoming from you. In our experience, they have been extremely responsive.
>
> * **Accessibility review**: We recommend involving a 508/accessibility expert to validate the behavior and confirm whether there are interim workarounds or if this presents a hard stop. 
>
> * **Canvas technical support**: Canvas does advertise compatibility with both SCORM 1.2 and 2004 exports. We recommend checking with their support team to see if there are recommended configurations or settings that could address the navigation and screen reader issue. 
>
> * **Alternative approach**: If SCORM remains problematic, another option would be to bypass the SCORM export altogether and rebuild the content directly in Canvas using the markdown files. This would allow for more direct control over accessibility and alignment with your LMS environment.
> * **Tip**: Using H5P plugins may hinder the functionality in Moodle and other LMSs.
