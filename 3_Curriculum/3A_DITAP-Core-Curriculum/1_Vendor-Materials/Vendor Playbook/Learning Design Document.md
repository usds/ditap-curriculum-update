# DITAP Learning Design Document
This learning design document serves as a blueprint for facilitators to ensure that learning objectives, activities, content, and assessments are all aligned. It's incorporated into the curriculum to provide consistency, clarity, and alignment across different modules or courses. By mapping out the “why,” “what,” and “how” of learning, it ensures that every activity ties back to defined outcomes, prevents gaps or redundancies, and creates a coherent learning journey for participants.
