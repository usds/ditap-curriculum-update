# Welcome to the DITAP Vendor Playbook 

This playbook is here to help you deliver the refreshed Digital IT Acquisition Professional (DITAP) program with clarity, confidence, and consistency. The DITAP program is a multi-modal training and development experience delivered over months at a time, built around a cohort-based learning approach that emphasizes collaboration, peer learning, and practical application. Inside, you will find the program structure, key requirements, competency-based content, and essential learning activities, along with tips, tools, and examples to make facilitation smoother and more engaging. While it provides a clear framework to ensure a high-quality experience for every cohort, it also leaves room for you to adapt delivery to your style and your learners’ needs. Think of it as both a guide and a partner, supporting you from planning through delivery so together we can create impactful learning experiences that prepare participants to succeed in real-world acquisition environments.

## Program overview

The Digital Services Credential (DITAP), formerly FAC-C-DS, program aims to train and develop professionals for this certification, focusing on digital service acquisition. It requires a comprehensive approach that includes pre- and post-course assessments, multi-modal training delivery utilizing a learning management system, and evaluation based on participation, mastery of content, and a live digital assignment. The program emphasizes a cohort-based learning approach which can be both in-person or fully remote for the majority of facilitation or the majority of content. The curriculum, structured in modules and sprints, covers competencies such as understanding digital services, effective buying techniques, contract administration, and leading change in digital IT acquisition, with the goal of providing participants with practical skill development through real-world application and problem-solving. 

## Program structure

The DITAP program is organized to guide participants through a progressive learning journey that blends knowledge building with hands-on application. Its structure combines sequential modules, practical activities, and applied projects in a way that reinforces learning over time. The design ensures that each topic builds on the last, moving participants from understanding core concepts to confidently applying skills in real-world acquisition scenarios.

### Core design principles for delivery

- **Cohort-based learning:** Participants move through the program together, building peer networks, sharing perspectives, and supporting each other’s growth. This sustained engagement is key to the program’s success.
- **Blended, multi-modal delivery:** Learning takes place through a mix of live facilitation, online modules, group discussions, and hands-on assignments.
- **Technology-enabled experience:** Vendors must use a learning management system (LMS) to host course content, track progress, and facilitate discussions. Webinars and other collaboration tools, such as discussion boards or shared workspaces, should be used to enhance interaction and access.
- **Integrated assessment:** Progress is measured through pre- and post-program assessments, active participation, demonstrated mastery of content, and successful completion of a live digital assignment (LDA).
- **Anchor learning in real work**: Use the case study, threaded activities, and Live Digital Assignment to give participants realistic scenarios where they can apply new skills in their own agency context.

### Program modules

The program is divided into five modules, each with multiple sprints that serve as subtopics within the module. These sprints break the content into focused segments, allowing participants to explore specific concepts in depth while building toward the module’s overall learning objectives. The five modules are:

1. **Describe**: Explore what digital services are, who provides them, how they are delivered, and why they are important. Includes an overview of delivery methods (Agile, Human-Centered Design, DevSecOps) and a “Tech Bootcamp” covering data, software, cloud, AI, security, accessibility, and open source.
2. **Discover**: Learn how to assess agency readiness, map stakeholders, define success, and conduct effective market research to inform acquisition strategies.
3. **Design**: Translate discovery insights into a structured solicitation. Covers acquisition strategy development, solicitation creation, and evaluation planning.
4. **Build**: Manage vendor partnerships and guide delivery using Agile and lean principles. Topics include performance measurement, kickoff facilitation, and problem resolution.
5. **Grow**: Strengthen the ability to lead change and foster innovation at both the individual and organizational level.

### Target audience

- Required: FAC-C (Professional) holders with at least two years of experience in digital service acquisitions over the FAR 13.500(c) threshold.
- Encouraged: FAC-COR Level II/III and FAC-P/PM Level II/III holders with similar experience, especially those working in cross-functional teams.

## Applicant selection

Selecting the right participants is essential to creating a dynamic learning environment and achieving the program’s intended outcomes. While the DITAP program includes formal eligibility requirements, vendors are encouraged to view applicant selection as an important step in shaping the cohort experience. Thoughtful selection can help ensure that participants bring a mix of relevant experience, motivation, and openness to learning, which in turn supports deeper engagement, richer discussions, and more meaningful application of skills back in the workplace.

### Minimum requirement

For questions regarding minimum requirements and eligibility criteria, please refer to the "Who can enroll in the DITAP program?" section in the TechFarHub.

### Recommended screening process

Although not required, vendors are encouraged to implement a screening process to assess fit for the program. This can include reviewing application responses, conducting brief interviews, or seeking input from the participant’s supervisor. The goal is to ensure each participant is ready and able to engage fully in the cohort experience.

### Attributes of an ideal candidate

An ideal participant will typically:

- Demonstrate a willingness to experiment, share knowledge, and collaborate with peers.
- Show commitment to applying new skills in their role rather than attending simply to complete a requirement.
- Work in an organization that supports applying the DITAP certification in practice after program completion.
- Have an interest in digital service acquisition, even without a formal IT background.
- Exhibit a positive, change-oriented mindset while acknowledging the realities and challenges of technology acquisition in government.

## Orientation - course start

A strong program launch sets the tone for the entire learning experience. Orientation is an opportunity to establish the cohort community, build connections among participants, and provide a solid foundation for the content to come.

### Optional enhancements

- Cohort Connection: Orientation must be delivered in person to foster a sense of community among participants and reinforce the cohort-based nature of the program.
- Introduction to Agile: A hands-on “Introduction to Agile” activity is required to give participants—especially those without a digital services background—a clear understanding of agile concepts and practices. This can be achieved through experiential exercises such as Play-Doh or LEGO simulations, or other interactive activities that make agile principles accessible and memorable.
- Icebreaker activities
- Guest speakers from government or industry
- Additional activities or topics tailored to the cohort’s needs

### Supporting materials

Orientation materials from the DITAP Refresh are provided in the Refresh GitHub Repo.

## Graduation - course end

Graduation is an opportunity to recognize participant achievement, celebrate the learning journey, and reinforce the value of applying skills back on the job. While not required to be in person, a meaningful closing event can help sustain momentum and strengthen the alumni network.

### Required elements

- **Continuous Learning Points (CLPs):** Participants are eligible to receive 60–80 CLPs based on the delivery approach. Vendors must clearly state in the course materials the total CLPs that can be earned and how they are awarded.
- **Certificate of Completion:** Each participant must receive a training certificate including:
  - Course title
  - Full dates of the course
  - Participant’s full name
  - Name of the organization conducting the training
  - Number of CLPs earned
- **Graduate reporting:** Vendors must submit a final list of all certificate holders to USDS at <techfarhub@omb.eop.gov> so they can be added to the DITAP Alumni listserv.  

### Optional enhancements

- Guest speakers from government or industry
- Special recognition events or activities to mark completion

### USDS review  
USDS will review the CLP distribution approach, certification format, and graduation activities, whether in person or virtual.

**Supporting materials**
A sample certificate format is included in the Appendix.

## DITAP delivery: required and optional components

To support consistency across all DITAP deliveries, the following section identifies which elements of the program are required versus those that are optional. Required elements form the foundation of the program and ensure participants meet the learning outcomes set by USDS. Optional elements provide flexibility for vendors to enhance delivery with activities and assessments that best fit their facilitation style, participant needs, or agency context. Assignment timelines are flexible based on vendor delivery needs; however, all assignment requirements must be met and participants must complete each assignment as instructed.


| **Program Element** | **Required / Optional** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-Paced Content | **Required** | All core self-paced modules must be delivered and may be adapted as long as it meets the need of the learning objectives. Vendors may add supplemental materials, including images, video or audio files, charts and resources, to support the learning requirements; however, no content may be removed. |
| Activities (ILT or exercises) | Optional | Vendors may select or adapt activities to support facilitation style. |
| Applied skills assignments | **Required** | Includes shadowing, stakeholder activity, and live digital assignment. Vendors may add supplemental materials to support the learning requirements; however, no content may be removed. |
| Threaded case scenario | **Required** | Must be integrated across modules. Vendors may add supplemental materials to support the learning requirements; however, no content may be removed. The threaded case study may be replaced with an alternate case study, provided it remains structured as a threaded case study. |
| Pre- and post-surveys | Optional | Vendors may administer as part of evaluation, not mandatory. |
| Pre- and post-assessments | **Required** | A pre and post assessment must be administered. Vendors have the flexibility to adapt and adjust the choice of assessment as needed. You may add supplemental materials to support the learning requirements; however, no content may be removed. |

## Assessment and grading guidance

### Overview

The DITAP refresh reimagines assessment strategy to reflect modern adult learning principles. Rather than checking boxes, assessments build confidence through practice, feedback, and reflection while helping learners apply course concepts to real-world work.

Our assessment design is grounded in The Learning-Transfer Evaluation Model (LTEM), which moves beyond attendance and knowledge recall to measure decision-making, performance in realistic settings, and the foundation for on-the-job transfer and organizational impact.

**Vendor Flexibility**: Vendors have discretion to adapt their assessment strategy to their delivery format, learner needs, and agency-specific contexts while maintaining DITAP's core learning objectives.

---

### Pass/Fail structure

DITAP uses a pass/fail approach that encourages learners to focus on growth, collaboration, and real-world application rather than point accumulation. This mirrors the real-world environments they'll operate in.

### Requirements for completion

To successfully complete DITAP and earn a certificate, vendors must assess two areas:
1. **Participation** – Meaningful engagement in course sessions as measured by the provided rubric
2. **Conceptual Fluency**– Understanding and application of key DITAP tools and frameworks through applied learning assignments and pre vs. post assessment comparison.

### Progress indicators

Without formal grades, students need regular feedback to ensure they're on track. Use these indicators:

**On Track to Pass**

- Consistently contributes in discussions (see rubric)
- Accurately applies frameworks in assignments, no revisions required
- Completes all phases of the capstone project
- Demonstrates growth in post-assessment results

**May Be At Risk**

- Rarely participates (multiple "needs attention" ratings)
- Misses key deliverables
- Struggles to apply frameworks in assignments; revisions are required
- Shows little to no progress from pre- to post-assessment

---

## Participation assessment

### Participation rubric

The rubric evaluates three dimensions of engagement: 

|     | **Fully Engaged** | **Progressing** | **Needs Attention** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cohort Contribution** | Consistently contributes in live sessions; builds on others' ideas; prepared and engaged | Occasionally contributes; listens actively; sometimes prepared | Rarely participates or comes unprepared |
| **Connections** | Frequently connects course content to real work; shares relevant examples | Makes occasional connections between course and work | Struggles to relate content to context |
| **Emergent Thinking** | Regularly introduces new perspectives; demonstrates curiosity and depth | Sometimes surfaces thoughtful ideas | Rarely explores beyond surface-level |

## Participation assessment implementation
_Timing: During/after interactive sessions, especially those tied to the threaded case scenario_.

| **Type of Assessment** | **Description** | **Suggested Cadence** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Participant self-assessment | Using the rubric, learners reflect on their own engagement and identify one area for growth. | Once per module | Rarely participates or comes unprepared |
| Assessment by peers | Pairs or small groups provide one observation and one suggestion using rubric. | Twice per course |
| Assessment by facilitators | Instructors use the rubric to guide individual or group feedback after observed sessions. | Twice per course | 

### Intervention guidance

Schedule a facilitator check-in when a participant meets either criterion:

- Two consecutive "Needs Attention" ratings in the same dimension, OR
- Three total "Needs Attention" ratings across any dimension during the program

Use the rubric to guide conversations and offer concrete re-engagement strategies.

---

## Conceptual fluency assessment

Conceptual fluency is the ability to understand, apply, and clearly communicate key DITAP tools and frameworks (Digital Services Playbook, TechFAR, human-centered design principles) in realistic work contexts.

### Assessment components

#### Pre- and post-course assessments

- **Pre-Assessment**: Informational and diagnostic only. Establishes baseline understanding and helps vendors identify instructional emphasis areas.
- **Post-Assessment**: 80% required for pass/fail determination. Confirms minimum conceptual fluency for DITAP framework mastery.

  - Multiple attempts allowed
  - After first failure, redirect to challenging sections of schedule facilitator check-in.
  - After multiple failures, provide additional interventions (peer coaching, office hours, targeted practice).
  
<br>

### Applied learning assignments

- Stakeholder Research Assignment
- Shadowing Assignment
- Live Digital Assessment (LDA)

<br>

**Stakeholder research and shadowing assignments**

- Specific instructions for what constitutes passing are provided in dedicated playbooks [link to playbooks]
- In short, both assignments have two phases:
  - Phase 1: Requires approval to proceed
  - Phase 2: Requires passing grade for completion

 
**Live Digital Assignment (LDA)**

- DITAP's capstone experience simulating the complete lifecycle of a digital services acquisition
- Participants apply key DITAP concepts in real-world context through four phases:
  - Discovery Sprint
  - Case Study Development
  - Peer Evaluation
  - Final Presentations
- The Case Study Package is assessed as a **gated Pass/Fail**, meaning learners must pass to continue. All phases are essential for learning and completion and pass/fail criteria are provided for each phase in the LDA playbook. [link to LDA playbook]

<br>

### Knowledge checks

Embedded throughout self-paced modules to help learners identify misconceptions early and practice key concepts. While successful completion isn't required for advancement, vendors must track participation and performance patterns to guide facilitation and support.

<br>

---

## Continuous Learning Points (CLPs)

Participants in the full 6-month DITAP program should be eligible to receive 80 CLPs upon successful completion of all program requirements.

For shorter or adapted versions of the program, training providers should work with USDS to determine the appropriate CLP allocation. The total number of CLPs and the criteria for earning them should be clearly stated in the course materials provided to participants.

<br>

---

## The Learning-Transfer Evaluation Model (LTEM) Alignment

DITAP assessments are intentionally designed using the Learning-Transfer Evaluation Model (LTEM), created by Will Thalheimer. LTEM provides a framework for measuring learning effectiveness beyond attendance or satisfaction surveys, progressing from basic measures of participation and engagement (Levels 1–3) to deeper measures of knowledge, decision-making, and performance (Levels 4–6), and ultimately to transfer and organizational results (Levels 7–8).

### LTEM levels in DITAP

| **LTEM Level** | **Description** | **DITAP Examples** | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. **Participation** | Learners are present for live sessions and complete required self-paced modules. | Zoom attendance logs; LMS completion records; average learning time. |
| 2. **Engagement** | Learners actively engage with required learning activities and assignments. | Time spent in lessons; whether videos are watched in full vs. fast-forwarded; frequency and quality of questions asked during live sessions; self-paced knowledge check completion; assignment submission (before feedback). |
| 3. **Learner perceptions** | Learners report the relevance, quality, and effectiveness of the course. | End-of-course survey; mid-course pulse check; reflections on perceived skill growth and confidence. |
| 4. **Knowledge** | Learners recall and accurately describe key facts, terms, and frameworks tied to course outcomes. |Knowledge checks in self-paced modules; accurate use of terminology in class; conceptual fluency demonstrated during discussion and assignments. |
| 5. **Decision-making** | Learners choose appropriate actions or solutions in realistic scenarios. |Responses in the threaded case scenario; scenario-based knowledge checks; decision-making prompts in live sessions; conceptual fluency shown when weighing trade-offs or justifying choices. |
| 6. **Performance (in learning environment)** | Learners demonstrate skills effectively in realistic but low-risk practice settings. | Conducting stakeholder interviews; applying HCD tools in problem-framing exercises; delivering LDA case study presentations; all applied learning. |
| 7. **Transfer (on the job)** | Learners apply new skills and approaches in their real work environment. | [Assessed post DITAP, Consortium to own] Alumni survey 30–60 days post-course asking for specific examples; Best practice: manager interviews to confirm observed behavior changes. |
| 8. **Results** | Tangible, measurable organizational or mission-level improvements linked to the learning. | ((Assessed post DITAP, Consortium to own))  Agency reports of faster procurement cycles, cost savings, improved collaboration, or time savings tied to DITAP graduates; documented ROI of learning initiatives. |

<br>

### Progressive skill building

This structure creates scaffolded learning:

- Participation and early activities establish engagement and basic knowledge.
- Knowledge checks and applied assignments provide low-stakes decision-making practice.
- Capstone project demonstrates comprehensive performance ability in realistic conditions.


### Beyond the course

LTEM Levels 7 (Transfer) and 8 (Organizational Results) are assessed after course completion, and the DITAP consortium is actively working on measurement strategies for these levels. Level 8 represents the gold standard of organizational impact but may be challenging to achieve given agency constraints and the multiple factors beyond DITAP training that influence organizational outcomes. Successful completion of DITAP's assessment structure positions participants to achieve these higher levels after the program concludes.

<br>

## Implementation requirements summary

Each vendor must implement an assessment plan that includes:
1. Meaningful participation measurement using engagement rubrics with ongoing feedback opportunities
2. Consistent conceptual fluency measurement across multiple elements:
    - Pre-course and post-course assessment administration
    - Embedded knowledge checks in self-paced learning
    - Applied learning assignments (shadowing, stakeholder research)
    - Cumulative capstone project simulating real-world digital acquisition challenges

Vendors may supplement with additional assessments based on delivery format, learner preferences, or agency-specific contexts.

## Threaded Case Scenario Guidance


### Purpose of case scenario integration

This guide provides a high-level overview of how vendors delivering the DITAP program should approach the integration of a case scenario across the course modules. It outlines the purpose of the case scenario, expectations for integration across the curriculum, and guidance for selecting alternative case studies if needed.

### Case scenario overview

The recommended case scenario for the DITAP program is _Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges,_ written by Cynuria. This case provides a multi-phase scenario aligned with key DITAP competencies and supports learners in connecting theory to practice in a realistic digital acquisition context.

The Cynuria case scenario includes multiple milestones and decision points designed to evolve alongside the course curriculum. It is structured to:

- Introduce a realistic digital acquisition challenge (CRM procurement)
- Showcase policy, technical, and stakeholder complexity
- Enable applied learning through scenario-based activities
- Foreshadow and revisit decision-making moments in alignment with course content

Two versions of the Cynuria case scenario are available:

- **Comprehensive version**: This version includes both facilitator and student guidance. It is structured with clear milestones and aligned touchpoints for integration across modules. It’s the most thorough and detailed resource.
- **Narrative version**: This version presents the same core scenario in a shorter, story-driven format. It’s designed for readability and engagement, and may include narrative cliffhangers to spark discussion. Vendors may choose to use this version as a supplemental or primary reading depending on audience and delivery style.

Vendors are encouraged to use the Cynuria case scenario unless they have a compelling reason to substitute another. If a different case scenario is used, it must:

- Include multiple touchpoints across at least four modules
- Feature a narrative that evolves and builds in complexity
- Include opportunities for stakeholder analysis, solution evaluation, delivery planning, and leadership or change management
- Allow learners to apply frameworks and decision-making tools across modules
- Reflect realistic constraints and trade-offs in government digital acquisition

<br>

#### Pacing guide

The threaded case scenario unfolds alongside the course modules, with each activity reinforcing key concepts and building toward an integrated understanding of digital service procurement. Some activities are core milestones drawn directly from the Cynuria case materials; others are extension activities designed to deepen learning or connect to real-world application. The pacing chart below outlines when each case activity appears, which sprint it aligns to, and how it connects to major course milestones.

| **Module** | **Sprint** | **Activity Title** | **Case Scenario Milestone Alignment** |
|------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Module 1** | Sprint 1 | Introduction to Cynuria Case | Not a formal milestone, serves as Case scenario narrative intro |
| **Module 2** | Sprint 1 | Stakeholder Mapping | Milestone 1 |
| **Module 2** | Sprint 4 | Market Research Planning | Not a formal milestone, builds on Milestone 1 |
| **Module 2** | Sprint 4 | FAR 10 Integration Assignment | Not a formal milestone. It’s an extension activity. |
| **Module 3** | Sprint 1 | Solution Evaluation with SWOT Analysis | Milestone 2 |
| **Module 3** | Sprint 2 | Evaluating Data Security Solutions with SWOT & Cost Estimation | Milestone 3 |
| **Module 3** | Sprint 3 | Designing a Solicitation Strategy | Not a formal milestone, builds on Milestones 2 and 3 |
| **Module 4** | Sprint 3 | Laying the Groundwork for Agile Delivery | Applies prior decisions from Milestones 2 and 3 |
| **Module 4 or 5** |  | Laying Out a Recommendation | Milestones 4 & 5 |
| **Module 5** | Sprint 3 | Leading Change and Navigating Resistance | Integrates entire case context |

<br>

#### Integration guidance

Vendors are responsible for ensuring the case scenario is threaded throughout the curriculum in a way that:

- Aligns with the learning objectives of each module
- Reinforces key digital service delivery principles and practices
- Provides a common anchor for group discussion, assignments, and applied activities

Integration may vary slightly depending on program design, but generally includes:

- Early exposure to the full case scenario (Module 1)
- Deep dives into individual milestones aligned with module competencies (Modules 2–3)
- Continued reference during planning and implementation content (Modules 4–5).
- Synthesis and final presentation using the case (Module 6)

Vendors should ensure that:

- Participants receive the full case scenario early in the program
- Assigned readings are clearly communicated in advance of each module
- Participants are given multiple opportunities to apply tools and concepts to the case throughout the course

<br>

## Facilitating the threaded case study

### General facilitator guidance

#### Purpose of the case scenario

The threaded case scenario is a tool for deepening understanding and sparking application across the course. Through a fictional—but realistic—procurement scenario, participants explore the complexity of digital service delivery in government and connect course concepts to their own day-to-day challenges. The case scenario helps participants:

- Apply concepts in a realistic, evolving context
- Practice critical thinking, stakeholder engagement, and strategic decision-making
- Surface parallels to their own work and identify opportunities for influence and improvement

Each case scenario activity reinforces the sprint’s learning objectives and serves as a springboard for meaningful, context-specific conversation.

_Detailed guidance for each activity—including suggested framing, timing, and prompts—is available in the corresponding facilitator guide._

<br>

### Flexible format

Most case activities are run in small groups with a brief whole-group share-out. Refer to the pacing guide for timing recommendations and feel free to adjust based on group size, energy, and time available. There’s plenty more room for creativity in how you run these sessions. Think of what’s provided as a springboard.

<br>

### Key facilitation moves

**Anchor in course content**  
Use the case scenario to reinforce frameworks and key ideas introduced in each sprint—drawing from both live session slides and self-paced materials.

**Create call-back moments**  
Encourage learners to connect current decisions to earlier moments in the case or in their own work. What patterns or assumptions are still at play? How have past decisions shaped the present?

**Promote evidence-based reasoning**  
Ask learners to ground their analysis in specific details from the case—emails, timelines, decisions, and organizational behavior.

**Bridge to lived experience**
If groups get stuck, invite reflection on their own environments. What makes collaboration hard across functions? What constraints or opportunities do they see in their work?

**Challenge assumptions** 
Prompt participants to identify and question assumptions Casey’s team may be making. What’s being overlooked? What alternate paths are possible?

**Broaden perspectives** 
Encourage groups to consider nontraditional sources of insight, such as frontline staff, legacy system documentation, or indirect stakeholders.

**Connect discovery to design** 
Especially in Modules 2–3, guide learners to see how early discovery findings shape later acquisition and implementation decisions.

**Elevate learner expertise**  
Your role is to create space for rich discussion—not to lecture. Emphasize the expertise in the room.

**Right-size the vendor role**  
Encourage analysis of how participants themselves can lead and influence—rather than focusing only on vendor behavior or external constraints.

## LMS Guidance

As part of the course introduction, vendors should provide learners with a brief orientation to the Learning Management System (LMS). This orientation should be tailored to the specific LMS being used and designed to help learners feel comfortable navigating the system from the start. The goal is to set learners up for success, reduce confusion, and ensure they can focus on the course content.

### Key elements to cover in your LMS orientation include:

**Accessing the LMS:** Provide clear instructions for logging in, setting up accounts, and accessing the course. Include relevant links and any credentials learners may need.

**Course layout and structure:** Give an overview of how the course is organized, including the modules, lessons, and any assessments. Highlight where learners should begin and the recommended progression through the content.

**Finding key course elements:** Show learners where to locate modules, assignments, assessments, required materials, and other resources. Clear navigation instructions will help learners find what they need quickly.

**Tracking progress:** Explain any progress indicators available in the LMS, such as completed modules or scores, and how learners can use these tools to monitor their own learning.

**Communication tools:** Outline how learners can interact with instructors/facilitators, support staff, and peers. This might include discussion boards, messaging features, announcements, or office hours.

**Technical support:** Provide information on how learners can get help if they encounter technical issues, including contact points and response expectations.

### Integrating materials into your LMS

Vendors should ensure that all course materials, modules, assessments, and other materials are properly integrated into their LMS. This includes uploading files, linking to external resources, and configuring assessments so that learner progress and completion are tracked accurately. Clear labeling, consistent module sequencing, and accessible navigation are critical to providing a seamless learner experience. Whenever possible, test the course in the LMS environment before launch to confirm that all interactive content, links, and tracking functions work as intended.

Vendors should design and integrate course materials in accordance with accessibility standards, ensuring all learners, including those with disabilities, can engage with the content. This includes providing alternative text for images, captions or transcripts for videos, keyboard navigation for interactive elements, and clear, consistent formatting for readability. Vendors should also ensure that color choices, font sizes, and contrast meet accessibility guidelines, and that all links and instructions are clear and descriptive. Incorporating these practices from the start helps provide an inclusive learning experience and supports compliance with accessibility requirements.

### LiaScript integration

This course was built using LiaScript, an open-source framework for interactive online learning. LiaScript allows for dynamic content, such as embedded quizzes, multimedia, and branching scenarios. Learners can complete exercises directly within the course environment, receive immediate feedback, and track their progress in real time. For course providers, LiaScript supports flexible formatting and consistent presentation across modules, making it easier to maintain quality and accessibility standards.
