## Scenario 1: Modernizing a Legacy System Amidst Organizational Inertia
You are a Contracting Officer assigned to a critical modernization effort for your agency's core financial system. The current system is decades old, highly customized, and difficult to maintain. Previous attempts at modernization using traditional "big-bang" waterfall methods have failed, leading to significant financial waste and a deeply entrenched culture of risk-aversion within leadership. There's a strong resistance to adopting modern digital service acquisition practices like agile or human-centered design. Everyone agrees the system is problematic, but no one wants to "rock the boat." You realize your expertise in digital services acquisition is crucial to shifting this mindset and setting the acquisition on a successful path.


### Question 1
**As the Contracting Officer, your immediate goal is to address the deeply rooted cultural resistance and foster an openness to new approaches. Which of the following is the optimal first step to initiate change in this risk-averse environment?**  

Relevant modules: Module 2 (Assessing Agency Readiness) and Module 5 (Leading Change as an Individual)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Mandate a series of training sessions on agile and digital services best practices for all program staff, emphasizing past failures of waterfall methods. | Incorrect | While training is important, mandating it, especially with a focus on past failures, can exacerbate resistance and be perceived as accusatory rather than collaborative. It doesn't address the underlying fear of trying something new. |
| B | Propose a small, low-risk pilot project that applies one modern digital service practice to a non-critical component, co-presented by a trusted colleague from within the program office. | Correct | In a highly risk-averse environment, radical proposals or mandates are likely to be met with resistance and "no" responses often stem from fear. The DITAP curriculum emphasizes starting small, framing changes as experiments or pilots, and working with trusted internal champions to build momentum and address fear of failure. This approach allows the team to test the new methodology on a limited scale, demonstrate success, and gradually build trust and buy-in, aligning with the "buy small, miss small" principle. |
| C | Compile and present a comprehensive report to senior leadership detailing the financial benefits and reduced risk of agile development compared to traditional methods. | Incorrect | A report, while informative, can be a passive approach. Senior leadership in a risk-averse culture may dismiss it as theoretical without practical, low-risk demonstration. Emotional appeal and practical experimentation are often more effective than pure logic in overcoming ingrained resistance. |
| D | Immediately request a contract modification to pivot the current development effort from waterfall to agile, leveraging the authority of your Contracting Officer role. | Incorrect | This is an aggressive and high-risk move that is likely to be met with outright hostility and resistance, as it forces change without addressing the organizational readiness or building consensus, directly contradicting the approach to leading change in a challenging environment. |

### Question 2
**During a stakeholder interview, a key technical lead expresses skepticism about agile, stating, "It sounds too chaotic; we need rigid plans to control costs and ensure security." Given this, which strategy should you employ to most effectively advance a change towards agile adoption?**  

Relevant modules: Module 2 (Assessing Agency Readiness) and Module 5 (Leading Organizational Change)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Immediately provide them with detailed agile frameworks and certifications that demonstrate the structured nature of agile. | Incorrect | This is a "send them more info" approach, which is often ineffective because it doesn't address the underlying emotional or experiential barriers to change. It assumes a knowledge gap rather than a mindset or trust issue. |
| B | Engage them in a conversation about past project struggles, focusing on how rigidity led to costly rework and missed user needs, then introduce agile as a risk-reduction strategy. | Incorrect | While past failures are relevant, directly blaming rigidity can lead to defensiveness. It's better to focus on solutions and common goals than to dwell on past mistakes in a way that assigns fault. |
| C | Acknowledge their concern about control, and propose a collaborative exercise to explore how agile's iterative feedback loops and continuous monitoring can enhance control and risk management for security and cost. | Correct | This approach embodies finding common ground and tailoring the message to the stakeholder's concerns. By acknowledging their fear (loss of control, security, cost), you create an opening to reframe agile not as chaos, but as a method that provides better control and risk management through transparency, frequent feedback, and continuous integration/delivery. The DITAP program emphasizes continuous monitoring and iterative delivery as methods to manage risk. |
| D | Inform them that agile is now federal policy and that the agency must comply with modern IT acquisition practices. | Incorrect | This is an "assert authority" approach that will likely increase resistance and hostility without building trust or understanding. Leading change requires more than just stating policy; it requires building relationships and buy-in. |

---

### Question 3
**The current contract performance metrics, designed for a waterfall approach, indicate failure to meet needs. You also notice challenges with the existing culture and processes.  Which option is the best tactic to get things moving in the right direction?** 

Relevant modules: Module 4 (Performance Measurement Under Agile Delivery Contracts) and Module 5 (Leading Organizational Change)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| A | Publicly highlight how other agency waterfall projects are also struggling to build a case for agile. | Incorrect | This can foster a negative, blame-focused environment rather than a constructive, solution-oriented one. It may alienate potential allies and reinforce defensive behaviors. |
| B | Engage people within the agency who are already open to agile concepts and hold influence with or are key stakeholders, empowering them to champion the change. | Correct | This strategy focuses on building a guiding coalition and leveraging internal champions, which is a key step in leading organizational change. By empowering those already open to agile and who have influence, you create a self-sustaining momentum for change from within the organization, rather than forcing it from the outside. |
| C | Review the relevant statutes, such as FITARA, with the program manager to assert the force of law for digital modernization. | Incorrect | While statutes provide authority, relying solely on statutory force without building relationships and buy-in is likely to be met with passive resistance or workarounds, similar to the pitfalls of using "expert power" inappropriately. |
| D | Initiate a formal review of the program office's organizational structure to identify barriers to agile adoption and propose mandatory re-organization. | Incorrect | This is a top-down, potentially disruptive, and highly political approach that can generate significant pushback and erode trust. Incremental changes and building trust are preferred when dealing with cultural resistance. |

## Scenario 2: Launching a New Enterprise Digital Service

You are a newly warranted Contracting Officer responsible for a significant new digital services contract. This enterprise-level system will consolidate and streamline several manual processes across various agency departments, impacting thousands of employees and external users. Your agency leadership and the program office are enthusiastic about adopting modern digital service acquisition principles, but you recognize that digital service expertise is not yet widespread within the agency. You have ample time for planning and are seen as the expert responsible for ensuring this complex project is delivered on time and within budget.


### Question 1: What is the most effective initial step to ensure the new enterprise system is designed to truly meet user needs and deliver mission outcomes? 

Relevant module: Module 2 (Define Success for your Digital Service Acquisition)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Work with the requirement owner and key stakeholders to facilitate a product visioning session to define the problem, desired future state, and high-level outcomes before moving to market research. | Correct | Defining success starts with clearly stating the problem and creating a product vision that focuses on outcomes, not pre-defined solutions. This approach, facilitated collaboratively with key stakeholders, ensures that subsequent market research and acquisition strategy are aligned with actual user needs and mission goals, preventing the wrong thing from being built. |
| B | Have all stakeholders email you their needs as user stories, then aggregate them and issue a draft Request for Information (RFI) for potential solutions. | Incorrect | This is a passive approach to defining requirements that can lead to misaligned or overly prescriptive solutions if the underlying problem isn't clearly framed first. RFI without a clear vision may yield irrelevant responses. |
| C | Host a large "industry day" to gather broad feedback from numerous vendors on potential technical solutions and market availability. | Incorrect | While market research is crucial, conducting it before a clear product vision and problem statement are established can lead to unproductive discussions or a focus on technology rather than user outcomes. Industry days are more effective when the government has a clearer sense of what they are trying to solve. |
| D | Conduct an internal technical assessment to identify existing legacy systems and data that the new system must integrate with, before engaging any other stakeholders. | Incorrect | While technical constraints are important, starting with only internal technical assessments without defining user needs can lead to a solution that is technically sound but fails to address the actual human problems or mission needs. It is one input, but not the optimal first step for a new system. |

### Question 2: The program office expresses reluctance to consider Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings because they haven't "gone to cloud yet" and are concerned about security. What strategy should you employ to start de-mystifying these technologies and inform the acquisition strategy?

Relevant modules: Module 1 (Digital Service Tech Bootcamp) and Module 2 (Assessing Agency Readiness)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Contract with a third-party consulting firm to provide a "magic quadrant" report on the best XaaS solutions, focusing only on FedRAMP-authorized options. | Incorrect | While Gartner-like reports can be useful, relying solely on external reports may not build internal trust or directly address the specific agency's cultural barriers or perceived risks associated with "going to cloud." |
| B | Assert that the agency must transition to cloud as part of federal mandates and highlight the cost savings of XaaS. | Incorrect | This top-down, authoritative approach is likely to increase resistance rather than foster understanding or buy-in. |
| C | Release a comprehensive Request for Information (RFI) for XaaS solutions to gather market research and force industry to explain their security postures. | Incorrect | An RFI might provide information, but it doesn't offer a direct, hands-on experience to alleviate skepticism. It can also be perceived as a theoretical exercise without tangible proof. |
| D | Propose a small-scale, low-risk pilot of a relevant SaaS solution for a non-critical agency function to demonstrate its security, usability, and benefits in a controlled environment. | Correct | A small, low-risk pilot directly addresses the de-mystifying aspect by providing experiential learning and tangible proof of concept, which can be highly effective in overcoming skepticism and fear of the unknown. This aligns with the DITAP emphasis on experimentation and incremental change. |

---

### Question 3: You need to draft the solicitation for this complex digital service. The program office's initial draft is a prescriptive document with a fixed three-year waterfall approach. You want to shift it to be outcome-based, flexible, and encourage iterative development. Which approach is the best way to structure the solicitation to achieve this goal? 

Relevant modules: Module 3 (Develop a Solicitation)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Require offerors to submit a comprehensive technical proposal detailing their three-year waterfall plan with fixed deliverables and milestones. | Incorrect | This reinforces the problematic waterfall approach and directly contradicts the goal of iterative and agile development. |
| B | Convert the prescriptive requirements into a detailed Statement of Work (SOW) that specifies a phased, iterative delivery timeline. | Incorrect | An SOW, by nature, is more prescriptive than an SOO and risks retaining the rigid "how" that the program wants to move away from, even if it specifies phases. |
| C | Develop a high-level Statement of Objectives (SOO) that defines desired outcomes, key objectives, and performance standards, allowing offerors to propose their "how." | Correct | A Statement of Objectives (SOO) is explicitly designed for outcome-based acquisitions, allowing vendors to propose innovative solutions and methodologies (their "how") to achieve the government's desired "what". It promotes vendor innovation, aligns with agile and iterative delivery, and prevents the pitfalls of overly prescriptive requirements. |
| D | Focus the solicitation on evaluating the past performance of vendors who have successfully executed similar large-scale waterfall projects. | Incorrect | While past performance is important, focusing solely on it for waterfall projects may select vendors that are not adept at modern digital service delivery or agile methodologies. |

---

### OPTIONAL - Question 4: What funding strategy best supports large-scale digital transformations while maintaining flexibility and reducing risk?  

Relevant modules: Module 3 (Acquisition Strategy Design) and Module 4 (Contract Management and Performance)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Provide full funding upfront for the entire transformation project to ensure commitment and reduce administrative burden. | Incorrect | While upfront funding may seem efficient, it locks the agency into a rigid structure, increases financial risk, and reduces the ability to adapt to evolving needs or market conditions. |
| B | Allocate incremental funding aligned with modular contracting and iterative delivery milestones. | Correct | Incremental funding tied to modular contracting and iterative delivery reduces financial risk, increases accountability, and allows flexibility to adjust priorities and resources as needs evolve. This aligns with agile acquisition principles and DITAP guidance. |
| C | Use a single contingency fund to cover all unforeseen changes over the multi-year transformation. | Incorrect | A single contingency fund can help cover risk but does not provide the structure or transparency needed to align funding with delivery outcomes. |
| D | Delay major funding decisions until the project nears completion, after outcomes can be fully assessed. | Incorrect | Waiting until the end of the project undermines the iterative and incremental nature of agile delivery. Funding must be aligned with near-term goals and deliverables to ensure accountability throughout. |

## Scenario 3: Managing a Multi-Vendor Digital Transformation Program

You are the Contracting Officer for a major digital transformation program that involves consolidating several legacy systems into a new, modular enterprise platform. To mitigate vendor lock-in and foster innovation, the agency has opted for a multi-vendor strategy, awarding separate contracts to five different vendors for interconnected modules (e.g., identity management, data analytics, user interface, legacy data migration). While this approach offers flexibility, it has introduced complex challenges related to integration, shared accountability, and consistent performance measurement across the different vendor teams.


### Question 1: Given the multi-vendor environment, what is the best practice for effectively governing shared responsibilities, ensuring seamless integration, and fostering collaboration among the different vendor teams? 

Relevant module: Module 4 (Management of Digital Service Delivery and Performance Measurement Under Agile Delivery Contracts)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Implement strict, individual contract clauses for each vendor, holding them solely accountable for their module's performance, with separate performance reviews. | Incorrect | While individual accountability is necessary, relying solely on it without mechanisms for shared governance and collaboration will lead to integration breakdowns and finger-pointing when issues arise across modules. |
| B | Establish a "Governance Hub" or Center of Excellence (CoE)-style team with representatives from all vendor teams and government stakeholders to align goals, share practices, and resolve issues jointly. | Correct | In a multi-vendor environment, the government acts as a Delivery Marketplace Architect. Establishing a "Governance Hub" or CoE-style team is a best practice to ensure aligned goals, quick issue resolution, and inter-vendor collaboration. This fosters a culture of shared success, transparency, and continuous improvement, rather than siloed efforts. |
| C | Require all vendors to use the same proprietary project management and communication tools to centralize oversight and control. | Incorrect | While shared tools can be helpful, mandating a proprietary tool might introduce vendor lock-in or additional costs for some vendors, and it doesn't automatically solve the problem of coordination or accountability. |
| D | Minimize inter-vendor communication to prevent collusion and ensure intense competition, relying on the government team to be the sole integrator. | Incorrect | This is a detrimental approach that directly contradicts the need for transparency, collaboration, and shared understanding in complex, interconnected systems, increasing risks of duplication and sequencing issues. |

### Question 2: Your program wants to ensure that the agile-developed components across different vendors work seamlessly together in the final integrated platform. Which approach to incorporating warranties will best mitigate integration risks and ensure accountability for the overall system quality? 

Relevant module: Module 4 (Performance Measurement Under Agile Delivery Contracts)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Apply "sprint-level warranties" where each deliverable integrates seamlessly with all previously accepted sprint deliverables and meets security/performance requirements. | Correct | Agile-specific warranty strategies, such as sprint-level warranties, are designed to ensure that each iteratively developed component functions and integrates with prior work. This proactively addresses integration risks throughout the development lifecycle, rather than waiting for a big-bang final acceptance, which can lead to costly late-stage discoveries. This aligns with continuous integration and testing. |
| B | Implement traditional 12-month warranties that begin only after final acceptance of the entire integrated system by the government. | Incorrect | This approach is problematic for agile, iterative development because it delays feedback on integration until the very end, making it costly and difficult to correct issues. |
| C | Rely on vendor Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for uptime guarantees, assuming they cover integration quality. | Incorrect | SLAs primarily cover uptime and performance of a service, not necessarily the quality or seamless integration of iteratively developed software components across multiple vendors. They are a part of a solution, not the whole. |
| D | Waive all warranties to encourage innovation and rapid iteration from the vendors. | Incorrect | While innovation is encouraged, waiving all warranties exposes the government to significant risk regarding functionality, security, and long-term maintainability of the digital service. DITAP emphasizes balancing protection and innovation. |

---

### Question 3: After several sprints, you observe a decline in reported velocity and an uptick in defects within one vendor's module, despite automated tests still showing satisfactory results. The program office cannot specifically identify the problem. Which is the best response to address these issues and understand their root causes?  

Relevant module: Module 4 (Performance Measurement Under Agile Delivery Contracts and Contract Management and Problem Resolution)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Formally document the concern in a letter to the contractor, directing them to immediately increase velocity and provide consideration for the performance decline. | Incorrect | This is an adversarial, top-down approach that is likely to create defensiveness and may not uncover the true root causes, especially if the issue is systemic or related to interdependencies. |
| B | Increase the number of Quality Assurance (QA) labor categories on the contract to manually re-test all features and identify bugs. | Incorrect | While more QA might identify more bugs, it doesn't address the underlying reasons for the declining velocity or defects, which could be process-related, technical debt, or team dynamics. It's a symptomatic fix, not a root cause solution. |
| C | Conduct a joint root cause analysis (RCA) session with both government and vendor stakeholders, using data from various sources (e.g., velocity charts, defect logs, team surveys) to identify systemic issues. | Correct | A joint root cause analysis (RCA) emphasizes a "learn from it faster" approach rather than blame, which is crucial in agile environments. This involves using data-driven retrospectives and transparent documentation to uncover systemic issues, not just surface-level symptoms. Interviewing stakeholders independently to determine roadblocks is also a good step. |
| D | Terminate the task order for default, citing the declining velocity and increased defects as evidence of non-performance. | Incorrect | This is a drastic measure that should be a last resort. Terminating without understanding the root cause, especially when automated tests are still "satisfactory," can be premature, costly, and disrupt the larger modular program. |

### OPTIONAL - Question 4: How should cybersecurity be integrated across multiple vendors to ensure secure delivery in a modular environment?  

Relevant modules: Module 1 (Digital Service Tech Bootcamp) and Module 4 (Delivery Management and Performance)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Rely solely on individual vendors to address their own security requirements within their modules. | Incorrect | Leaving cybersecurity siloed within each vendor increases risks of gaps and inconsistencies. Security must be integrated across the ecosystem. |
| B | Require a coordinated DevSecOps framework with shared practices, continuous monitoring, and government oversight across all vendors. | Correct | Coordinated DevSecOps practices ensure security is embedded throughout development, tested iteratively, and aligned across all vendors. This reduces risks of vulnerabilities at integration points and supports compliance requirements (e.g., FedRAMP, NIST). |
| C | Perform a one-time security audit at the end of the integration phase to confirm compliance. | Incorrect | A one-time audit is too late in agile, multi-vendor environments. Security must be continuous and iterative. |
| D | Centralize all cybersecurity responsibilities exclusively within the government’s internal IT office. | Incorrect | While the government plays an oversight role, vendors must also embed security into delivery. Shared responsibility is essential. |

---

### OPTIONAL - Question 5: When transitioning vendors in a modular, multi-vendor environment, what is the best strategy to reduce the risk of knowledge loss and ensure continuity?  

Relevant modules: Module 3 (Solicitation Development), Module 4 (Delivery Management), and Module 5 (Leading Organizational Change)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Require vendors to submit knowledge transfer deliverables (documentation, code repositories, and staff shadowing) as part of contract closeout. | Correct | Requiring structured knowledge transfer ensures continuity during vendor transitions. Deliverables such as documentation, open repositories, and shadowing protect the government from knowledge loss and reduce transition risks. |
| B | Assume new vendors will discover needed knowledge on their own during onboarding. | Incorrect | This creates inefficiencies, delays, and risks of rework. Transition must be proactively planned. |
| C | Extend incumbent vendor contracts indefinitely to avoid transition risks. | Incorrect | This fosters vendor lock-in, reduces competition, and undermines innovation. |
| D | Encourage departing vendors to voluntarily share best practices at the end of the contract. | Incorrect | Voluntary sharing is inconsistent and insufficient to ensure continuity. Formal contract requirements are necessary. |

## Scenario 4: Procuring AI-Enabled Solutions for Public Services

Your agency is exploring the procurement of a new AI-enabled tool to assist in processing citizen applications. The proposed tool uses machine learning to identify patterns in submitted documents and flag anomalies for human review, aiming to increase efficiency and detect potential fraud. While there is enthusiasm, your team has concerns about the potential for algorithmic bias, data privacy, and ensuring human oversight. As the Contracting Officer, you need to ensure the procurement strategy addresses these ethical and practical challenges.



### Question 1: When establishing evaluation criteria for the AI-enabled tool, which of the following is the most critical factor to prioritize to mitigate concerns about algorithmic bias and ensure fairness in citizen application processing?  

Relevant modules: Module 1 (Digital Service Tech Bootcamp) and Module 3 (Developing a Solicitation)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | The vendor's adherence to a specific AI development methodology, such as "Agile AI" or "Waterfall AI." | Incorrect | While development methodology is important for project execution, it doesn't directly address or ensure bias mitigation within the AI's functionality itself. |
| B | The vendor's ability to provide a comprehensive, explainable AI model that details data sources, bias mitigation strategies, and audit methods for its decisions. | Correct | AI in government systems requires careful consideration of transparency and bias. The DITAP curriculum specifically states that when procuring AI solutions, solicitations should require vendors to describe data sources, bias mitigation strategies, and how their models can be audited or explained. Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for accountability and legal defensibility. |
| C | The proposed cost-effectiveness of the AI solution in terms of reducing manual review hours. | Incorrect | Cost is a factor, but prioritizing it over ethical concerns like bias could lead to significant negative consequences, including public mistrust and legal issues, outweighing any financial savings. |
| D | The vendor's experience implementing AI solutions for other government agencies, regardless of their specific bias mitigation practices. | Incorrect | Past experience is valuable, but it's not sufficient unless it explicitly includes demonstrated success in managing and mitigating bias in those past implementations. It doesn't guarantee the necessary ethical considerations are in place for this specific solution. |

---

### Question 2: Your program manager is excited about integrating an open-source library into the core of the new AI-enabled system, believing "open source is free and means the government owns everything." How should you, as the Contracting Officer, address potential intellectual property (IP) and data rights concerns to ensure the agency maintains necessary control and flexibility?  

Relevant modules: Module 1 (Digital Service Tech Bootcamp) and Module 3 (Developing a Successful Acquisition Strategy)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Confirm that open-source software is always free and that the government automatically gets unlimited rights to any derived custom code. | Incorrect | This is a dangerous misconception. Assuming unlimited rights without proper contractual language and understanding of licensing terms can lead to legal issues and limited control. |
| B | Explain that open-source software has specific licensing agreements and copyright protections that affect ownership and reuse, and ensure the contract includes clauses to secure necessary government rights, such as Government Purpose Rights or unlimited rights for custom development. | Correct | Open-source software has licensing agreements (like GPL or BSD) and copyright protections. The government needs to understand these licenses and use appropriate FAR clauses (e.g., FAR Part 27, 52.227-14) to negotiate and assert its desired data rights for custom software developed with open-source components, maximizing control and reusability. |
| C | Advise the program manager to proceed, but secretly retain a separate proprietary backup solution in case the open-source integration fails. | Incorrect | This is not a transparent, ethical, or practical approach to managing procurement and IP. It avoids addressing the core issue and can create further problems down the line. |
| D | Require the vendor to patent the integrated open-source solution in the government's name to ensure full ownership. | Incorrect | Open-source software is publicly licensed; attempting to patent it would violate its licensing terms and is not a valid way to secure government ownership. The focus should be on data rights and usage licenses rather than patenting. |

---

### Question 3: To ensure ongoing accountability and ethical use of the AI-enabled application post-award, what is the most effective strategy to ensure continuous human oversight and the ability to intervene if the AI's decision-making process becomes problematic or biased over time?  

Relevant modules: Module 3 (Developing a Solicitation), Module 4 (Management of Digital Service Delivery), and Module 5 (Leading Organizational Change)

| Option | Description | Correct/Incorrect | Feedback |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| A | Implement performance standards requiring the vendor to maintain human oversight capabilities for AI-powered systems and establish clear procedures for manual intervention and model updates post-award. | Correct | Continuous human oversight and control are key considerations for government systems using AI. The DITAP curriculum emphasizes the need to require vendors to maintain human oversight capabilities for AI-powered systems and establish procedures for manual intervention in the event of automated system failures. This also aligns with the need for post-award monitoring and addressing model drift in AI. |
| B | Require the vendor to provide quarterly performance reports summarizing the AI's accuracy rates. | Incorrect | While reports are useful, they are a lagging indicator and do not guarantee proactive human oversight or the ability to intervene in real-time or near real-time if a problem arises. |
| C | Rely on automated testing tools to continuously monitor the AI's output, assuming they will detect all emerging biases. | Incorrect | Automated tools are valuable but may not capture all forms of bias or unforeseen ethical issues. Human judgment and intervention are still critical complements to automated testing, especially in complex AI systems affecting citizens. |
| D | Conduct a one-time pre-award ethical review of the AI model, and then trust the vendor to self-regulate its performance. | Incorrect | AI models can experience model drift and develop biases over time as they interact with new data or environments. A one-time review is insufficient for continuous assurance and accountability. |
