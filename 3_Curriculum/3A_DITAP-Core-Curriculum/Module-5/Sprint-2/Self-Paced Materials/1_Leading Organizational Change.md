# Staying Current and Driving Change: Your Role in Continuous Improvement
**Module 5 Sprint 2**

> _Average completion time: 60 - 75 minutes_

## Why Continuous Learning Matters in Federal Acquisition

Technology and policy in the federal space are evolving faster than ever. From emerging tools like artificial intelligence to policy shifts that emphasize modernization, acquisition professionals must stay ahead of change, not react to it.

In your role, you’re not just supporting procurement, you’re enabling agency success. Your ability to adapt, learn, and apply new knowledge directly impacts how effectively your agency meets its goals.

But keeping up doesn’t just happen. It takes intention. Continuous learning isn’t a one-time event, it’s a mindset and a habit. By staying curious, seeking out new tools and trends, and learning from each acquisition you manage, you build resilience and stay relevant in a fast-changing environment.

Continuous learning also strengthens your ability to lead change. Whether you're exploring new contracting strategies, testing out new digital tools, or mentoring others, your growth can create a ripple effect across your team and agency.

In today’s environment, continuous learning isn’t optional; it’s a core part of being an effective, future-ready acquisition professional.

By the end of this sprint, you will be able to assess your strengths and change style to develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within your agency and the broader government community.

## Staying Current with Emerging Tech and Trends

Technology is reshaping the way the federal government delivers services, and acquisition plays a central role in making it happen. From artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to automation and cloud-native solutions, emerging technologies are influencing everything from how agencies define requirements to how vendors respond.

### Why It Matters

Emerging tech isn’t just for IT teams. Staying informed about technology trends empowers you to:

* Engage in more meaningful conversations with program and technical staff.  
* Structure solicitations that reflect modern capabilities.  
* Anticipate how industry might respond to your requirements.  
* Support mission delivery with smarter, more adaptive contracts.

### Tech in Action: Generative AI and Federal Acquisition

Take generative AI as an example. It has already begun influencing how acquisition professionals:

* Conduct **market research** by analyzing vendor data more efficiently.  
* Draft or refine **performance work statements** using AI-assisted language tools.  
* Create **procurement templates** that reflect emerging best practices.

This type of fast-moving innovation requires curiosity and a commitment to staying informed, even when formal guidance is still evolving.

### Where to Watch for Tech Trends

You don’t need to be a technologist to stay tech-aware. Here are trusted sources where you can spot trends relevant to acquisition:

* **[US Digital Service (USDS)](https://www.usds.gov/)** – Insight into user-centered, tech-forward project delivery
* **[TechFAR Hub](https://techfarhub.usds.gov/)** – Guidance and examples of applying tech in acquisition
* **Agency Innovation Labs** – Many agencies (e.g., DHS, HHS) have internal labs testing new tools and methods  
* **[FedScoop](https://fedscoop.com/)** – News and updates on federal IT and innovation
* **[Digital Services Coalition](https://digitalservicescoalition.org/)** – A network of vendors focused on digital government  

### Tracking and Engaging with Tech Influencers

Staying current also means learning from the people shaping the conversation. You can:

* **Follow thought leaders** on platforms like LinkedIn or tune in to interviews on Federal News Network

 
* **Join professional organizations** like:  <br>
    - **[NCMA](https://ncmahq.org/)** – National Contract Management Association  <br>
    - **[Technologists for the Public Good](https://www.publicgood.tech/)** – nonprofit professional association connecting technologists from across government and industry to modernize public-sector services  <br>
    - **[Apolitical](https://apolitical.co/en)** – a Certified B Corporation which offers training opportunities for the public service and free communities on subjects like **Innovative Procurement**  <br>
    - **[ACT-IAC](https://www.actiac.org/)** – Public-private partnership events and reports on federal tech <br>
  

* **Subscribe to curated content** that filters the noise and brings key updates to your inbox:  
  * Federal News Network newsletters  
  * FAI (Federal Acquisition Institute) Acquisition Today newsletter

### Making It a Habit

It’s easy to fall behind if learning isn’t part of your routine. Here are small but effective ways to stay on top of change:

* **Set a monthly “tech check” reminder** to scan newsletters or skim recent articles  
* **Join quarterly briefings or virtual roundtables** offered by GSA, ACT-IAC, or your agency’s digital team  
* **Add tech trend reviews** to after-action discussions or procurement retrospectives  
* **Block time during less busy weeks** for self-guided learning or event replays

### Final Thoughts

You don’t need to be an expert in AI, cybersecurity, or cloud architecture. But understanding the direction technology is heading and how it’s shaping your acquisition environment makes you a more strategic, forward-thinking contracting professional.

Staying current isn’t about keeping up with every trend, it’s about staying connected enough to ask smart questions, spot opportunities, and support your agency’s evolving needs.

## Self-Reflection: Your Tech Awareness Habits (Optional)

Take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions. You can jot down your responses or simply pause to think them through:

1. **How do I currently stay informed about changes in technology or acquisition practices?** *(e.g., newsletters, team discussions, events, personal reading)*  
2. **What challenges have I faced in keeping up with emerging trends?**  
    *(e.g., time constraints, information overload, lack of relevance)*  
3. **What’s one small habit I could start to stay more current?**  
    *(e.g., setting a monthly “tech check” reminder, following a specific newsletter or expert)*  
4. **Who in my agency or network is already good at this? Could I learn from or connect with them?**

## Continuous Improvement in Everyday Procurement

Continuous improvement doesn’t always require a big initiative. In fact, some of the most valuable changes come from the small, repeatable steps we take after each procurement. By pausing to reflect, collaborate, and refine, you can strengthen your acquisition process and contribute to a culture of innovation, one project at a time.

### Conducting Mini "Lessons Learned"

After each procurement, take time to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. This doesn't have to be formal, just 20–30 minutes of focused discussion with your team or program partners can surface valuable insights.

You might ask:

* What worked well in this acquisition?  
* What slowed us down or caused confusion?  
* Were the requirements clear and accurate?  
* Did we get the responses we expected from industry?

Even a quick review helps you avoid repeating mistakes and reinforces good practices.

### Try an Agile-Style Retrospective

Borrowing from Agile project teams, consider holding a **procurement retrospective** at the end of each buy, especially for larger or more complex efforts. A retrospective is a short, structured meeting where the team discusses:

* What went well  
* What didn’t go well  
* What we’ll do differently next time

This lightweight practice builds a habit of learning and positions your team to continuously improve across procurements.

Use the template below to guide your Procurement Retrospective and reflect on what worked well, what didn’t, and what to improve next time.

#### Procurement Retrospective Template

**Project/Procurement Name:**  
 *E.g., “Cloud Migration Services BPA – Q2 FY25”*

**Retrospective Date:**  
 *E.g., June 30, 2025*

**Participants:**  
 *E.g., CO, Contract Specialist, Program Staff, COR, Legal, SMEs*

---

1\. What went well?

*   <br>
*   <br>
*  <br>

---

2\. What could have gone better?

*    <br>
*    <br>
*  <br>

---

3\. What should we try next time?

*    <br>
*    <br>
*  <br>

---

4\. What should we repeat or reinforce?

*   <br> 
*    <br>
*  <br>

---

5\. Lessons Learned Summary

*(Summarize the top 1–3 takeaways in 1–2 sentences.)* <br> <br>

---

6\. Next Steps / Action Items

| Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

---

Tips for Using This Template

* **Timebox to 30–45 minutes** for focused, efficient discussion.  
* **Encourage a no-blame environment**—this is about learning, not fault.  
* **Capture action items clearly**, with accountability and timelines.  
* **Share a summary** with the team or archive it in a shared location for future reference.

### Refine Your Tools Over Time

Templates, checklists, and communication workflows should evolve based on experience. For example:

* Update market research templates to reflect new tech or outreach strategies  
* Refine evaluation criteria to better reflect lessons learned from industry responses  
* Improve communication timelines or milestone checklists with each cycle

Small updates over time can lead to significant time savings and better outcomes.

### Collaborate Early and Often

Working closely with program staff, especially on **iterative requirement development**, helps reduce rework and misalignment. Continuous improvement starts with shared ownership. Ask program leads for feedback on acquisition support, and share what you learned from your post-award reflections.

### Document and Share What Works

Sharing what worked—and what didn’t — with peers or newer contracting officers fosters collective learning. Whether you write a short summary in a shared folder, post a quick note in your team’s collaboration space (e.g., Teams, Slack), present a “top 3 takeaways” at a team meeting, or contribute to an internal playbook, knowledge sharing turns individual experience into agency-wide progress.

### Final Thoughts

You don’t need permission to improve. You just need a process. Continuous improvement in procurement is about reflecting, adapting, and applying small changes that add up over time. The result? Better buys, stronger collaboration, and more effective support for your agency’s mission.

## The Case for Creating Practical Guides: From Playbooks to Toolkits and Beyond

### Why Practical Guides Matter

In a world where priorities shift quickly, and government work often spans legacy systems, new technology, and evolving policy, all at once, practical guides serve as anchors. These aren’t academic white papers or compliance manuals. They’re the working memory of an organization, what to do, how to do it, and why it works.

From playbooks and field guides to toolkits and checklists, these documents help public servants act with clarity and confidence. When done well, they create space for consistency and flexibility, helping teams avoid reinventing the wheel without boxing them in. Practical guides are useful not because they prescribe every step, but because they distill collective experience into something others can learn from, use, and adapt.

### Understanding the Playbook 

The concept of a playbook, with its roots in ancient military strategies and sports tactics, has transcended its original domains, organically spreading into a wide array of fields. This includes politics, where they inform campaign strategies; the military, with standard operating procedures; healthcare, through treatment protocols; education, via curriculum guides; marketing, in the form of communication strategies; and law enforcement, with procedural guidelines. In each of these contexts, a playbook functions as a metaphor for an organized, strategic approach to navigating complex tasks or situations. It represents a curated collection of tried-and-tested methods, often compiled from accumulated experience and best practices, all aimed at achieving specific outcomes.

The evolution of playbooks from rigid, detailed instructions for military maneuvers or sports plays to flexible, guiding frameworks underscores a profound shift in organizational philosophy. Modern playbooks, by emphasizing guidance over dictation and fostering autonomy, reflect a deeper understanding of how organizations function effectively in dynamic environments.

Within the fast-paced tech industry, business playbooks have become indispensable tools, addressing critical operational challenges and fostering a culture of efficiency and innovation. For instance, a playbook can meticulously detail the steps for handling customer complaints or executing a marketing campaign, guaranteeing consistent outcomes across all interactions.

High-performance product teams in the tech industry leverage playbooks to:

* **Cultivate a Learning Mindset**: They encourage the development and deployment of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) to maximize learning opportunities and minimize waste in the development cycle. 
* **Establish Continuous Feedback Loops**: Through practices like feature walkthroughs, story kickoffs, product demos, and bug bashes, these teams ensure a constant flow of feedback, which drives rapid and valuable product development.  
* **Conduct Action-Oriented Retrospectives**: Playbooks guide teams to ensure that retrospective meetings translate discussions into specific, actionable items, assign clear ownership, and include follow-up mechanisms, thereby empowering teams to drive tangible positive outcomes.  
* **Promote Knowledge Sharing**: They advocate for creating psychologically safe spaces where all team members feel comfortable sharing their knowledge, fostering a "teacher-learner culture" that reinforces mastery and collective growth.

### Beyond the Playbook: Types of Practical Guides

Not all guidance needs to come in the form of a playbook. In fact, the most effective digital service teams often draw from a variety of practical formats depending on their goals, audience, and moment in the project lifecycle. From high-level frameworks that map strategic decisions to tip sheets you can reference mid-meeting, these tools serve different but complementary purposes. Below is a breakdown of common types of practical guides—what they’re best for, how they differ, and real examples you can borrow or build upon.

**Playbooks**: Strategy-focused and flexible. They outline general approaches and common scenarios, often broken down into "plays."

- [Tech Challenge Playbook](https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/field-guides/tech-challenge-playbook/)
- [Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.usds.gov/)

**Field Guides**: Tactical and on-the-ground. Often tailored to a specific audience, use case, or project phase.

- [TechFAR Hub Field Guides](https://techfarhub.usds.gov/resources/learning-center/field-guides/)
- [Digital.gov Human-Centered Design Guide](https://digital.gov/guides/hcd/)

**Toolkits**: Resource-rich. Usually include templates, worksheets, and how-tos.

- [Federal Evaluation Toolkit](https://www.evaluation.gov/evaluation-toolkit/)
- [Gov.UK Open Policy Making Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-policy-making-toolkit)

**Cheat Sheets & Tip Sheets**: Lightweight and fast. Designed to be referenced in real time.

- [CDC’s Tip Sheet for Clear Writing](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/clearwriting/docs/clear-writing-guide-508.pdf)

**Workbooks**: Interactive and reflection-driven. Useful for trainings and onboarding.

- [Microsoft’s Citizen Experience Self-Assessment Workbook](https://info.microsoft.com/rs/157-GQE-382/images/IDCMicrosoftCitizenExperienceWorkbook2022222202224158.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Blueprints or Frameworks**: High-level guidance with pathways and decision points.

- [Australia Government’s Digital Service Standard Framework](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/digital-experience/digital-service-standard)


All of these can be living documents that evolve over time—and they should.

### The Role of Guides in Tech and Government Work

In digital services and procurement, the best guides are shaped by the work itself. They reflect the real challenges and lessons teams face: the security hurdles, the policy gray areas, the user needs that were harder to pin down than expected.

A good practical guide doesn’t start from scratch. It connects the dots across what’s already known: past successes, near-misses, and repeatable strategies. That’s why they’re so valuable in government, where historical knowledge often lives in inboxes or walks out the door when someone retires.

Practical guides help:

* Standardize quality while allowing for local adaptation.  
* Onboard new team members faster.  
* Support decision-making in complex or unfamiliar situations.  
* Preserve institutional knowledge.  
* Promotes user-centered thinking.

### Creating Your Own: What Makes a Guide Practical

Here’s what separates a practical guide from a dense report or policy doc:

* **It has a purpose**: Who is this for? What do they need to do?  
* **It’s actionable**: Readers should be able to use it right away.  
* **It’s written in plain language**: Skip the acronyms and legalese.  
* **It includes context, but not fluff**: People need just enough background to understand how to apply it.  
* **It evolves**: It’s meant to be updated based on what people learn using it.

The best guides aren’t written in a vacuum. They’re co-created by the people doing the work. They document how the team actually operates, not just how it should.

### When to Create One

Not every challenge needs a guide. But if any of these sound familiar, it might be time:

* You’re answering the same questions repeatedly.  
* Your team is trying to scale or onboard new people quickly.  
* A process is harder than it needs to be.  
* Institutional memory is at risk.  
* You want to spread something that worked well to other teams.

### A Tool for Culture Change

Creating and using practical guides isn’t just about documentation. It’s about culture. When teams invest time in making things clearer and more repeatable, they’re also investing in transparency, equity, and shared ownership.

Encouraging others to adapt and improve the guides over time makes them more than just a resource, they become part of how your organization learns. And when your guides are public or shared across agencies, they build bridges. They become proof that government can work smarter, together.

### Final Thoughts

In the public sector, these practical guides represent a strategic mechanism for navigating the complexities of digital transformation. They provide a structured approach to overcome challenges such as legacy systems, skill gaps, and bureaucratic inertia, effectively bridging the digital divide between the public and private sectors. Beyond mere standardization, playbooks in government play a dual role: they standardize effective practices while simultaneously driving cultural transformation. They instill new mindsets, emphasizing user-centricity and digital-first approaches, and cultivate an environment of agility, transparency, and innovation necessary to modernize public service delivery.

You don’t have to write a book. Sometimes all you need is a one-pager that helps someone take the next step with confidence. The goal of any guide, no matter the format, is the same:

**Make it easier for people to do the right thing well.**

So if you've got experience that others could benefit from, write it down. Call it a playbook, a field guide, a cheat sheet—whatever works. Just don’t let it stay in your head.

Start small. Keep it real. And make it shareable.

## Exploring your role as an ambassador of change

Earlier, you learned how to prepare for and have influencing conversations. Now, let’s explore how to think strategically about those influence conversations and how to use them, in combination with other tactics and techniques, to drive change. This online learning will build upon that study and focus on how to lead the change itself.

In this online module, you’ll learn about a framework to help you think about the phases of change and some specific strategies you can use to implement change at each phase.

### What Does Change Look Like in the 21st Century?

Change is one of the few constants. According to Dr. John Kotter, a Harvard Professor and authority on change and leadership, society is not only changing, it’s changing faster than ever before, and our capacity to keep up with said change is not maintaining the same pace.

Typically, change can be viewed as something that happens *to* you, rather than something that is created *by* you. This may be a symptom of position, or operating from the middle of the organization without a lot of formal authority. This may also be a matter of comfort or complacency; after all, if you’re not calling the shots, you can’t be blamed for the decision if it goes wrong (or so the thought process goes). Change can be scary, inconvenient, and cumbersome, but change can also lead to better, more efficient processes, innovative thinking, and a reinvigorated workforce.

### Start Small

A key best practice to leading change—whether leading change in how your agency operates or leading change in your own life (e.g., starting a new exercise regime), is to start with small, iterative changes. Choose something that is “easy” to adopt and implement. The success of even the smallest accomplishments can prepare you to succeed in bigger areas, as well as build your influence and reputation within your agency as a person who can accomplish tasks. It’s the same concept that underlies the “buy small/miss small” principle you learned about in earlier releases.

Once you’ve successfully accomplished one change, look for the next one. If the next change is bigger, analyze how to break it down into smaller pieces and work incrementally until the change is accomplished.

Watch the following [TEDx video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8) about accomplishing big change by building small habits and think about how you could apply this principle of starting small in your own work as a leader of digital acquisition change.

## Kotter Model Introduction

Over 40 years ago, Dr. Kotter began observing leaders and organizations as they tried to transform or execute strategies for change. Over time, Dr. Kotter was able to identify and extract the factors that lead to success and bring them together into a methodology and an eight-step process of pursuing change.

Let’s look at each of these eight steps by studying examples of companies, organizations, and even some unlikely heroes who have put each (if not all) of these steps into action.

![A circular diagram representing the 8 steps of Kotter's Model. The steps are presented as bubbles in a clockwise order starting from the top: 1. Create a sense of urgency. 2. Build a guiding coalition. 3. Form a strategic vision 4. Enlist a volunteer army. 5. Enable action by removing barriers. 6. Generate short-term wins. 7. Sustain acceleration. 8. Institute change](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/999f0210943953dccd872f0dbaf3ac191fb9ddf7/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-5/Module-5-Media/8Steps_Final_Transparent%20resized2.webp?raw=true)

*Figure 1 Source: [Kotter International](http://www.kotterinternational.com/the-8-step-process-for-leading-change/)*

### Step 1: Create a Sense of Urgency

Urgency is the fuel that ignites and drives the change. It replaces complacency.

Complacency says, “This is the way we’ve always done it” and that we could wait for some point in the not-so-distant future to try something different. Urgency says, “Time is of the essence.” These are important to keep in mind because, as mentioned earlier, technology and science is changing very quickly. To effectively and creatively respond to evolving needs, we have to be willing to change and try new things.

Relative success can breed a sense of comfort with the status quo, even if the status quo isn’t what brought you success. The problem with success is that it tells a story about the past and doesn’t necessarily dictate future performance. Take a company like Kodak for example. A leader in its industry, management never thought that the digital revolution would snap up its market share. So they stayed the same, failed to lead, and the rest is history.

While the Kodak example speaks to management, midlevel leaders are not exempt from leading change and being a part of the urgency. In fact, the entire step is to use your statement of opportunity to “raise a large, urgent army of volunteers.” Because you’re leading from the middle, change occasionally requires extra time, a little more faith, and a lot more patience for iterating processes. Whether you chose a small project or acquisition, you still have to describe an opportunity that appeals to the heads and hearts of your team. They must understand that the time is now to engage in this change. And they must help you recruit others who believe the same to help.

To do this, think back to the following:

* **Activity: Stakeholder Analysis**, where you learned techniques for engaging with your stakeholders and thinking about their interests. Specifically, the **Stakeholder Interests Template** and **Stakeholder Interview Guide Template** are useful starting points.  
* Then, think back to earlier in this module, particularly: **Preparing for and Having an Influence Conversation** and **Difficult Conversations**. In it, you learned about some common topics for difficult conversations.  
* Next, recall the influence conversations you conducted. Consider how to apply the techniques that were discussed within the context of the framework. As a refresher, communicate your goal, ask open-ended questions, use appropriate tone and words, handle emotions, explain technical concepts in a way that makes sense to your audience (don’t assume what will make sense—test it\!), position your effort as an opportunity for incremental change and experimentation, handle a negotiator who has all the “no’s” or a direct negotiator in a productive fashion, and encourage and gain commitment from others to participate in the change (which makes them more bought into and supportive of the initiative).

You can use all these techniques to execute Step 1 and build the “business case” for change. Consider how you might use these strategies to describe an opportunity that motivates your various stakeholders to action. How might you effectively tell the story and get them on board?

---

### Step 2: Build a Guiding Coalition

In your first step, you create a sense of urgency among those around you and see who buys-in to your idea. Within that group, “point” people will arise that help you to lead the change from various points across the organization. Think about your current processes and answer the following questions:

* How many people are necessary to move that process along?  
* Do each of these people understand the process and their role within the process?  
* If you were to attempt a small (or large) change to the acquisitions process, which people in your organization are the ones that see problems and create solutions?  
* Who is a good champion?  
* Who can smooth certain rough patches over for your idea?  
* Who are the people (in any department) that can be choke points in the process if they aren’t bought into an idea that you’re committed to enacting? How can you bring those people onboard now to prevent that in the future?

Identify those people and give them room to elevate themselves to the “guide” level in your coalition. If they see the value and the appeal of the change, they should capture the urgency themselves and help you to then guide, steer, and communicate with the group. Let’s look at a few examples of coalitions.

For a historical example of building your coalition, take a look at the **United Nations**. The United Nations is an international organization that came into existence during World War II to stop the Axis powers. Since the end of the war, they continue to function as leaders in preventing the re-occurrence of another world war.

In 1945, representatives from 50 nations met to create the Charter, which reaffirms fundamental human rights, calls out the principles of equal rights, and self-determination of all people, as well as international cooperation in solving economic, social, cultural, and humanitarian problems around the world. The formulation of the organization actually took place over several years and took time to get key stakeholders onboard.

Or consider **Congress**. A Representative or Senator introduces legislation on the floor, then it goes to Committee. Then, they must form a coalition in the committee to get it onto the floor for vote.

Our final example takes us into the worlds of fashion and social media that began with a flash event initiated by clothing store **Lord & Taylor**. The brand reached out to 50 “style influencers” and asked that they all post pictures in the same dress (styled however they wanted) within a certain window of time on the photo-sharing platform Instagram. This is an interesting example because Lord & Taylor knew that this would be a unique way to attract their customers – through the style influencers they trust and admire. Each influencers had the flexibility to style the garment and then saturate the market with the image. The dress sold out almost immediately\! While using brand and style bloggers or “Instagrammers” might not be a typical coalition, it’s actually a unique way to deliver your message to your client via a trusted source. Lord & Taylor recognized that the point of key players in your coalition was to build the bridge of trust when embarking on an uncertain or new task.

In your role, you might not be building world-changing coalitions or building fashionista coalitions, but the same principles used in those contexts apply to you. Say you’re looking to shift your digital services solicitations to be more outcome focused (instead of requirements focused). Think through the questions presented at the beginning of this section:

#### Building Your Guiding Coalition: Key Questions

| **Question** | **Considerations** |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **How many people are necessary to move that process along?** | This will depend on your organization and how big of a change you’re enacting. Perhaps you need someone in each of the areas of the organization (e.g., various technical specialties and procurement) and a few influencers in leadership. |
| **Do each of these people understand the process and their role within the process?** | In today’s digital world, roles are shifting daily as we work to keep up with the pace of technology change. Your role as a digital services acquisition ambassador is new. The level of collaboration you’ll have with your teams during contract administration is new. Therefore, take time to talk this through with those who you want to be part of the change process. Never underestimate the simple power of talking through and agreeing on roles and responsibilities at the beginning of any new initiative. |
| **If you were to attempt a small (or large) change to the acquisitions process, which people in your organization are the ones that see problems and create solutions?** | Use the information you’ve gathered in earlier activities within this program to answer this question. If you haven’t completed those activities, complete them now. |
| **Who is a good cheerleader?** | Use data from your experience working in your organization, as well as activities we recommended in this program, to answer this question. By “cheerleader,” we mean someone who has a positive attitude and can keep the team upbeat even when the going gets tough (see the section on Building Your Resilience from this module for discussion of how to handle the inevitable tough patches). |
| **Who can smooth certain rough patches over for your idea?** | Perhaps this is a supportive leader like your supervisor or someone else with influence in the organization who supports your idea. |
| **Who are the people (in any department) that can be choke points in the process if they aren’t bought into an idea that you’re committed to enacting? How can you bring those people onboard now to prevent that in the future?** | Remember our discussion of this point in the Stakeholder Analysis Activity. We’ve all had those experiences where we forget to bring someone onboard who makes things tough later in the process. Save yourself time and headache—and potentially add to your guiding coalition—by getting all stakeholders (or as many as you can realistically identify now) on board. Revisit this question and the building of your coalition over time as you learn more during the change process. |


As scientist Margaret Mead stated, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.” It may sound trite, but it is true.

### Step 3: Develop a Vision and Strategy

Next, clearly articulate your vision so that initiatives that build toward it make sense and perpetuate the sense of urgency you’ve built in Step 1\. Your vision needs to be clear picture of the future and include why people should strive to create that future.

Observe how a clear vision might work in different parts of your organization. Take a moment to think about where in your organization people are aligned around a single idea that inspires them to do things and move ideas forward. If you haven’t seen this so far, how can you create this coalescing?

We’ve identified three examples of popular tech companies and their visions. Analyze their vision statements and think about how these visions have helped them become leaders in their fields.

#### Vision Statements from Leading Tech Companies

**Google**

> *"To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful."*

**Amazon**

> *"To be Earth’s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online."*

**Apple**

> *"We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that’s not changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don’t settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we’re wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well."*  
> — **Apple CEO Tim Cook**


As consumers, we may not always be able to quote what a leading company’s vision is. However, many of them have a unique way that they share that with their consumers. 

As these examples illustrate, some companies tend to focus on how their work impacts the world; others talk more about what they’re doing internally; and still others present more of “here’s who we are” statements. Likewise, as a digital acquisition officer, think about how you can use strategies like this to convey your vision. You may not be creating and conveying vision for an entire billion dollar organization like these examples. However, the principles they use apply to each and every change initiative—and these organizations all started as ideas in someone’s head and those ideas had to be formulated into a vision that was then pitched and conveyed to others over time.

Think about the companies listed above. How are their visions similar? How are they different? What is it about their visions that really empowers them to bring about change in our world? How might you use their techniques to craft your vision in a way that’s impactful to your stakeholders?

### Step 4: Communicate the Vision and Enlist Your Volunteer Army

As the convener, it’s up to you to help others clearly see where you’re leading them and why. In order to act, people have to see that the image you created is not only a better or different way, but also that there is room for that person in this new reality you’re seeking to create. Then, each person understands exactly how their contributions lead to a collective desired future state where the vision becomes a reality.

Whether a teenage dystopian novel or the Civil Rights movement, a leader or a symbol was necessary to communicate a new possibility and then rally around it. Katniss from *The Hunger Games* and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. are very different figures, but they’re similar in that they galvanized people into action whether they wanted to or not. Now that we have our army and key people, it’s time to get to work.

Think about leaders you’ve encountered that are able to effectively communicate their message. What do they have in common?

---

### Step 5: Enable Action by Removing Barriers

Now that you’ve communicated your vision and tasked your volunteer army with actions, your job is to help them flow like water.

If there are roadblocks, help to navigate those with your formal and informal authority. Equip your army with the tools they need to navigate the change by directing people to specific resources, people, or locations to help them accomplish the tasks at hand. If there’s a system that people need help with, find the right people to get them what they need. Remember to get them what they need and get out of the way. Use the resources you’ve reviewed throughout this program and the change ambassador toolkit as a starting point. In addition, use the network you’ve built with your cohort and others you’ve interacted as your resources moving forward.

The team will build momentum towards change from one small success to the next small success. With extra obstacles out of the way, there’s less opportunity for your team to think that it’s a hard change. (You’ll learn more about this technique in the Online Learning: Resilience where we discuss Disney Pixar and how following Disney’s rough patch and then the acquisition of Pixar, the team worked together to remove obstacles to creativity that then allowed Disney Animation to thrive.)

Do your best as the convener of the volunteer army to keep your team building momentum. This does not mean micromanage, however. Creating access to tools, skills, or systems does not mean taking the task and doing it for them. Trust your army to get the job done.

Have you ever had a manager who was able to get you what you needed when you needed it? If you have, think about what made it work well. If not, think about how you can prepare yourself to anticipate the needs of your team.

### Step 6: Generate Short-Term Wins

Small successes should be “collected, categorized, and communicated, early and often, to track progress and energize your army to drive change.” Wins should be widely agreed upon as successes that, when celebrated, act to “pull” or intrigue the “skeptics.” They also help carry the army through the long-term rollercoaster of a new project or process. It also makes people feel better in the face of inevitable setbacks.

Here are some things to keep in mind when considering how to celebrate short-term wins:

* **Do it in the moment** – Catch people doing incredible work as they are doing it. Be specific and descriptive.  
* **Make sure you provide context** – A win doesn’t mean much if we don’t understand how it drives toward the ultimate goal, project completion, etc.  
* **Be authentic** – You have to mean it!

As a digital acquisition ambassador and leader, you’ll have to think through exactly what the small wins will be and the appropriate level of recognition that makes the right people pay attention, makes the team/army feel like they accomplished something, and helps give the army another celebration to look forward to.

---

### Step 7: Sustain Acceleration

Up to this point, we have rallied our army around a vision, empowered them to implement the vision, removed any barriers, and are celebrating those wins along the way. Change requires constant adaptation and course correction in order to maintain progress and keep moving forward.

Sustained acceleration is necessary because it ensures the process comes to a close. Taking your foot off the gas before the project is complete means wasted time, wasted effort, and wasted resources. The key to making the change stick sometimes is seeing it through to the end, which can be the hardest part. Maintaining acceleration helps to reinforce efforts in the previous steps and builds towards the next step.

As a leader what can you do to help your army to maintain their momentum? 

---

### Step 8: Institute Change

This step is where we make the change stick. The new behaviors required to make your project successful will need to be replicated and reinforced in a way that makes clear connections to how this contributes to the success of the organization.

Essentially, each step builds towards creating and reinforcing the habit. This is also where you use the information you gathered about potential roadblocks to habit creation and work through those so that new people entering into this process have few obstacles.

One example of successful institutional or societal change was the smartphone. The mobile phone initially was cumbersome. It wasn’t very efficient, and it was still primarily meant for making and receiving phone calls. It wasn’t until the smartphone revolutionized telecommunications and illustrated a new lifestyle that society developed the habit of relying on them for communication and so much more. Now it’s difficult to imagine life without them! 

Reflect on the ways the companies we have reviewed in this module made their changes or projects “stick.” What strategies can you adapt in your own work to make change “stickier”? 

## Application

In this online training, you studied the Kotter eight-step model for leading change. You saw examples of companies, organizations, and even some unlikely heroes who have put each (if not all) of these steps into action. Finally, you took time to think about and discuss what makes these steps work, how you have seen others use them, and how you can implement them yourselves.

Take some time to reflect on a few other items that you’ve learned about in this program that can help you on your change journey:

* How will your personal preference impact your implementation of any of the eight-step model?  
* How will you mitigate any areas where you might have challenges communicating or working with certain people?  
* How will you play up the areas where you have particular strengths?

Feel free to share your answers with your fellow participants and/or your supervisor/manager. They can help you fill in gaps, point you to new resources, or share ideas on how to use your strengths.

## Reflect & Apply

1. What style did you get? Do you agree with it? Why or why not?  
2. What’s one way you can use your strengths to promote change in your next procurement or team collaboration?  
3. Are there other styles you’d like to develop more intentionally? How might you start?

## Create Your Change Contribution Plan

Knowing your change style is a powerful first step. Now, it’s time to turn that insight into action.

Continuous learning and improvement don’t happen by accident, they happen through small, intentional choices made over time. This section prompts you to craft a simple plan to guide how you'll contribute to positive change in your agency, starting today.

Take a few minutes to reflect and jot down your responses to the prompts below. You’re encouraged to tie your personal strengths, whether you’re a Connector, Implementer, Strategist, or Challenger, to specific, concrete actions.

---

**Your Change Contribution Plan**

**1\. How will I stay informed about emerging tech and trends?**  
 *(Example: I’ll subscribe to the FAI (Federal Acquisition Institute) Acquisition Today newsletter and follow two gov tech leads on LinkedIn.)*  
 

**2\. What’s one change I’ll lead or support in my agency or team?**  
 *(Example: As a Connector, I’ll start a quarterly knowledge-sharing session on lessons learned in acquisition.)*  
 

**3\. What’s one learning habit I’ll strengthen this year?**  
 *(Example: I’ll set aside one hour each month for a “tech check” and review a recent article or case study.)*  
 

This doesn’t need to be a full strategic plan, just a focused way to anchor your strengths to action. Whether you’re mentoring a colleague, piloting a new procurement strategy, or simply building your tech fluency, **your contribution matters**.

>**Tip:** Want to take it further? Share your plan with a teammate, mentor, or supervisor to help stay accountable—and inspire others to do the same.
