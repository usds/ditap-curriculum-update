### I. Overview & Objectives

Learners will synthesize their insights from the full case study and the course. They will produce a written recommendation and deliver a team presentation outlining their approach to implementing a successful CRM system.

This culmination invites learners to apply the full arc of the DITAP curriculum—from discovery through delivery—to a case study scenario. The milestone outputs require integration of technical strategy, stakeholder management, agile governance, and change leadership.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Integrate insights from discovery, evaluation, and planning phases to support digital service implementation
- Synthesize tradeoffs and decisions into a coherent recommendation
- Communicate a strategic approach that demonstrates stakeholder empathy, technical understanding, and adaptive leadership
- Reflect on leadership growth through the case study experience

### II. Materials & Preparation

**Materials:**

- Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study Milestones 1–5
- Milestone 4 and 5 Instructions (Written and Presentation Guidance)
- Optional: Slide deck template

**Preparation Checklist:**

- Ensure each group has access to their Milestone 1–3 notes
- Prepare rubric for feedback or peer review (recommendation is to use standard class participation rubric but you may also use the rubric in the case study)
- Create timing guidelines for group presentations (e.g., 6–8 min)
- Create guidelines for feedback & Q&A round robin (e.g. Team 1 for Team 2, Team 2 for Team 3… Team 8 for Team 1)

**Pre-Read for Participants:**

- Review team outputs from earlier Milestones
- Review Milestone 4 and 5 guidance
  
### III. Session Agenda & Activities

#### Activity Title: Laying Out a Recommendation <br>

**Time:** 1-2 classes  
**Purpose:** To synthesize learning and present final case study recommendations.

- **Team Working Time** _(Optional as in class activity)_
    1. Provide time for teams to finalize their written analysis and 6–8 slide presentation decks.
- **Team Presentations**
    1. Each group presents their solution, covering:
        1. Summary of the problem
        2. Proposed solution
        3. Tradeoffs and rationale
        4. Key challenges and how they were addressed
        5. Stakeholder engagement strategy
        6. Implementation and performance tracking
    2. Remind learners their analysis will be assessed based on their ability to address stakeholder concerns, propose viable solutions, and justify their recommendations. Strong responses incorporate:
        1. **Stakeholder Management**: Ongoing collaboration with IT and Compliance
        2. **Integration**: Justifying the choice of custom APIs
        3. **Data Security**: Advanced encryption and audit plans
    3. They might consider these questions: How did your discovery decisions show up in your solicitation strategy? In your evaluation criteria? In your delivery plan?
- **Q&A and Peer Feedback Exchange: Round Robin Format**
    1. Assign each team in advance to give feedback to another.
    2. Ask all learners to use the provided rubric to evaluate each presentation.
    3. Model what thoughtful, constructive feedback looks like before the exchange.
    4. **Learner Instructions:**
        1. For your assigned team:
            1. Share one strength
            2. Offer one suggestion for improvement
            3. Ask one thoughtful follow-up question
    5. **Sample Feedback Questions:**
        1. “What did you learn during your analysis that surprised you?”
        2. “What would you revisit if you had more time?”
        3. “Which tradeoff was most difficult to justify?”
- **Reflection and Debrief (at least 30 min)**
    1. Revisit the **original purpose:** _“The purpose of this case study is to consider creative solutions to a realistic scenario… as there is often no single way to solve a problem.”_
        1. How did your final recommendation reflect the complexity of the challenge?
        2. Where did you make tradeoffs?
    2. **Learning Objectives:**
        1. Which stakeholder concerns were hardest to navigate?
        2. What helped clarify your direction?
        3. What insights came from evaluating integration and security options?
        4. What new skills or strategies did you practice?
        5. How did earlier modules (e.g., stakeholder mapping, delivery planning) shape your final approach?
    3. **Personal Growth:**
        1. What’s one takeaway about your own leadership or decision-making?
