# Activity: Who’s Who of Digital Services Teams 

## Introduction

This activity introduces participants to the landscape of digital service teams across government. The purpose is to help contracting professionals become familiar with these teams’ missions, organizational structures, and recent projects. By understanding the role and scope of digital service teams, participants can better anticipate collaboration needs, align acquisition strategies, and engage more effectively with stakeholders during procurements.

Facilitator framing should emphasize that the activity is not about memorizing acronyms but about building awareness of the ecosystem in which participants will operate. Encourage participants to connect what they learn about each team to their own contracting work, considering where these teams might show up as partners, stakeholders, or end users in acquisition efforts.

### Timeframe: 60 minutes total

* Intro & setup: 10 min  
* Breakout exploration: 20 min  
* Group report-out: 20 min  
* Final debrief: 10 min

### Step 1: Framing and instructions (10 min)

1. **Context setup**:  
   Today, we'll explore real Digital Service Teams (DSTs) government digital-native teams. We’ll look at their mission and focus, the kinds of projects they deliver, and the ways they work. We’ll also explore how their practices, partnerships, and public deliverables could inform or inspire your own approach to digital services acquisition.

2. **Tool walkthrough** (5 min):  
   * Share screen and show how to navigate the DSN Tracker at [https://digitalgovernmenthub.org/publications/dsn-dst-tracker/](https://digitalgovernmenthub.org/publications/dsn-dst-tracker/) — filtering by federal vs. state, team maturity, etc.  
   * Select one DST to showcase

3. **Assignment** (5 min):  
    In breakout rooms, your group will:

   * Select one DST from the tracker.  
   * Review its organization, mission, and recent work.  
   * Identify examples of how the team delivers and supports its projects (e.g., partnerships, tools, public deliverables, open source repos).  
       
   * **Provide template** (on slide):  
     * What to look for:   
       1. Team Name & Level of Gov’t  
       2. Mission/Vision/Values  
       3. Known Projects/Services  
          1. What kind of project are they working on? Any case studies?  
       4. Delivery practices  
          1. Any hints at how they work?  
       5. Stakeholders or Partners  
          1. Other agencies, state/local govt, vendors  
       6. Impact or Outcomes  
          1. Metrics, user stories, testimonials  
       7. Publicly Shared Artifacts  
          1. Design guides, playbooks, blog posts, open source repos

### Step 2: Breakout exploration (20 min)

* **Form groups** of 3–5 participants.  
* Participants select a DST and look for the information above.  
* **Support the rooms**:  
   The facilitation team drops into rooms to check progress, answer tech questions, and offer guidance.

### Step 3: Group report-out (20 min)

* **Present in main room**: Each group gets 5 minutes:

  1. Which DST and why?  
     * What caught your attention about this team?  
  2. What project caught your interest and why?   
  3. What surprised you?   
  4. What aligns with your procurement experience?

### Step 4: Large-group debrief (10 min)

**Discussion prompts:**

1. What similarities or differences did you notice between the DSTs your group reviewed and others in terms of mission, organizational structure, or recent work?  
2. Were there any innovative practices or strategies that stood out to your group that could inform future digital services projects?  
3. Thinking about what you learned, how might this influence the way your team approaches digital service procurement or collaboration with DSTs?
