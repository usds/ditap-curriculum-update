## I. Overview and objectives  
In this module, learners will explore what digital services are, how they are delivered, and why they matter. This session sets the foundation for the program by introducing the key concepts, players, and methods in modern federal digital acquisition. 

The case study, [*Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges*](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/In-Class-Materials/Case%20Study%3A%20Navigating%20Stakeholder%20and%20Decision-Making%20Challenges.md), created by [Cynuria](https://cynuria.com/), is introduced here as the threaded scenario for the program. By reviewing the full case early, learners gain a “journey map” of the key topics and challenges they will return to in future modules. This session will foreshadow Casey’s upcoming decisions and the cascading challenges they may face.

**Learning objectives:**

* Identify the major players and sources of digital service delivery.  
* Understand agile, cloud, and human-centered delivery methods.  
* Connect course content to a real-world case study scenario.  
* Analyze how federal acquisition processes can enable or constrain digital service delivery methods.  
* Define digital services and describe their key characteristics.

This is the first of several touchpoints with the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case, providing participants with a narrative thread that connects technical concepts with real challenges and decisions.

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to orient learners to the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case. It is *not part of the original case study* but helps surface early hypotheses and connections between course concepts and Casey’s environment. |

## II. Materials and preparation

**Required materials:**
* Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges Case Study: Full Version (Pre-read before class)  
  * Note: There’s a shorter, more narrative driven version provided as well.  
* Module 1 slide deck  
* Shared digital board (Jamboard, MURAL, etc.) for brainstorming

**Pre-Read for participants:**

* [*Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges*](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/In-Class-Materials/Case%20Study%3A%20Navigating%20Stakeholder%20and%20Decision-Making%20Challenges.md) Case Study

**Pre-Session facilitator preparation:**
* Review the full case study focusing on: Cloud Smart policy context, FedRAMP requirements, and stakeholder dynamics.  
* Prepare to connect Casey's challenges to broader federal digital transformation efforts. 
* Have examples ready of similar real-world federal CRM implementations (GSA Salesforce, etc.).

 **Facilitator talking points:**
* Emphasize how Casey's situation reflects the "Cloud Smart" vs. "Cloud First" evolution.  
* Connect Alex's integration concerns to common federal legacy system challenges. 
* Link Riley's compliance focus to actual federal security frameworks (FedRAMP, FISMA).

**Advanced discussion prompts:**
* How does Casey's situation reflect the broader federal digital transformation challenges?  
* What aspects of this scenario are unique to federal vs. private sector acquisitions?  
* How do the stakeholder dynamics here reflect common federal procurement tensions?

## III. Session agenda and activities

**Activity title:** Introducing Casey and the CRM Project  
**Time:** 60-75 minutes  
**Purpose:** To introduce the case and anticipate future challenges.

**Instructions:**
- **Case context setting (10 minutes)**  
   * Brief overview of federal cloud adoption landscape  
   * Cloud Smart policy background  
   * Federal vs. private sector acquisition differences  
- **Stakeholder mapping activity (20 minutes)**  
   * Small groups map Casey, Alex, and Riley's perspectives.  
   * Identify their success metrics and failure risks.  
   * Connect to broader federal roles (CIO, CISO, Contracting Officer dynamics).
- **Digital service methods connection (15 minutes)**  
   * Explicitly connect case challenges to agile, cloud, and human-centered design principles.  
   * Discuss how federal acquisition can enable or hinder these methods.
- **Predictions & pattern recognition (15 minutes)**  
   * Students predict decision points and likely outcomes.  
   * Facilitator connects predictions to common federal digital acquisition patterns. Capture themes on a shared board.  
   * Use student responses to connect to your experience if relevant and content that will be covered in the course.

**Optional add-on exercises:**
* Structured reflection questions that connect the case to the three key questions.  
* Research assignment: Find one real federal agency CRM implementation and compare it to Casey's situation.  
* Stakeholder empathy exercise: Students choose one character (Casey, Alex, or Riley) and maintain that perspective throughout subsequent modules.
