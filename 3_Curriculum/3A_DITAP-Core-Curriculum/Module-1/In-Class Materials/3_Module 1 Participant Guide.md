### Reflections on this module

## Welcome to module 1\!

We are at the beginning of what we hope will be a useful and fulfilling course for you and your colleagues. As you know, digital procurement can be challenging in such a broad and rapidly-evolving field. 

This guide will serve as your roadmap through the first Module of the course. Sections of this document will be used in different ways, so it is designed with your support in mind. You will use it as a reference both in and outside of class time. There is space for you to jot down your notes as you move through a variety of discussions and activities. We’ve tried to balance the learning experience, with some of the activities taking place in small groups, some in the full class, and some will be a bit of each. 

Let’s get started\!
