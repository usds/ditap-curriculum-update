      * Is this a case where we’d require human-in-the-loop review?

    **Debrief and key takeaways (5 min)**

    * Highlight 2–3 trends or dilemmas that surfaced.  
    * Reinforce: As contracting professionals, we don’t just buy tech—we shape how it’s used.

### 20. Discussion: Importance of defining security expectations  

Total time allocation: 5-10 min

#### Activity instructions: 

* **Purpose:** Missteps where security is very risky and can be costly in terms of credibility and monetarily. Learners will know what can be done to mitigate these risks.   
* **Expected outcomes:** Learners will be better able to avoid unnecessary security risks when procuring vendors' services.  
* **Materials needed:**   
  * None  
* **Instructions:**   
  Introduce the activity (what is it and why) and include what they can expect as to sequence of events and timing. 

  **Prompt:**   
  Have you seen a procurement where security expectations weren’t clearly defined? What happened?

| Facilitator themes to look for: |  
| :---- |  
| Vendor confusion or delays |  
| Security retrofits or costly rework |  
| Lack of accountability during an incident |  
| Audit or compliance failures |  
| Breach of sensitive data |

### 21. Discussion: Surfacing security risks early 

Total time allocation: 5–10 min

#### Activity instructions:
 
* **Purpose:** To apply what they've learned about security risks and procurement   
* **Expected outcomes:** Learners will be able to generate relevant, security-focused questions to ask during market research that help identify and mitigate risks early in the acquisition process.  
* **Materials needed:**   
  * None  
* **Instructions:**  
   Introduce the activity (what is it and why) and include what they can expect as to sequence of events and timing. 

  **Prompt:**   
  What’s one question a CO could ask during market research to surface security risks early?

| Facilitator themes to look for: |
| :---- |
| What frameworks or controls does the solution comply with (e.g., FedRAMP, NIST)? |
| How is data protected in transit and at rest? |
| How do you manage software supply chain risk? |
| What’s your incident response timeline? |
| Do you support integration with our IAM or SIEM platforms? |

### 22. Activity: What would you ask? 

Total time allocation: 15-20 min

#### Activity instructions:

* **Purpose:** Build confidence in procurement professionals to ask informed cybersecurity questions during pre-award planning.  
* **Expected outcomes:** Learners will be prepared to ask informed questions about their cybersecurity needs.  
* **Materials needed:**   
  * Breakout rooms  
  * Whiteboard and markers or digital sharing tool  
* **Instructions:**   
  Introduce the activity (what is it and why) and include what they can expect as to sequence of events and timing. 

  Divide learners into small breakout groups. Assign each group one of the four cybersecurity focus areas:

  * Security compliance  
  * Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
  * Vulnerability management  
  * SIEM integration  
  
    **Prompt:**  
    We’re going to break out into small groups for ten minutes. Then during the debrief, each group will share their questions.   

    **Prompt:**  
    You’re preparing for an early acquisition planning meeting. Based on your assigned topic, come up with 2–3 questions you would ask the technical or security team to ensure this requirement is built into the contract.

| Awareness of compliance as non-negotiable in federal systems |
| Understanding that compliance differs by system type (e.g., public-facing app vs. internal system) |
| Integration of security controls into evaluation criteria or SOW |
| Recognition of the CISO or security team's role in validating feasibility |
| Identity and Access Management (IAM) |
| Awareness that IAM is critical to prevent unauthorized access |
| Emphasis on integration requirements as early contract conditions |
| CO understanding that improper IAM alignment can lead to security gaps or deployment delays |
| Recognition of IAM as a shared responsibility |
| Vulnerability management |
| Differentiating patching from broader vulnerability management practices |
| Importance of timely remediation and continuous monitoring |
| Use of language like SLAs, CVSS scores, or risk thresholds |
| Linking this area to contractor performance requirements or QASP |
| SIEM integration |
| Understanding of SIEM as central to threat detection |
| Risk awareness of orphaned tools (i.e., systems not connected to centralized monitoring) |
| COs considering integration requirements during solicitation planning |
| Clear communication expectations in incident response scenarios |

* **Debrief:** Each group shares their questions. Facilitator comments on alignment with best practices.

| Optional Enhancements |

  * None  
* **Instructions:**   
  Introduce the activity (what is it and why) and include what they can expect as to sequence of events and timing. 

  **Prompt:**   
  What’s one thing you can do in your next contract to strengthen cybersecurity expectations?

| Facilitator themes to look for |
| :---- |
| Require integration with agency IAM/SIEM |
| Define patching and vulnerability management processes |
| Reference federal standards explicitly (e.g., NIST 800-53) |
| Include performance metrics tied to security practices |
| Build in security testing and validation checkpoints |
