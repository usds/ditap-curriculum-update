# Digital Services - The How
**Module 1 Sprint 2**

>_Average completion time: 90 minutes - 2 hours_

The rapid pace of change in the digital industry, shifting consumer expectations, and budget pressures of doing more with less drive the U.S. Government to adopt new approaches for designing, developing, and delivering digital services.  

Just as defining the digital services landscape can seem complex, so can trying to explain how they are developed. While there is no one-size-fits-all process for how digital services should be developed, there are contemporary practices that can help the government build more effective digital services. 

After this module, you will be able to:

- Identify strategies to help you identify user needs
- Describe contemporary practices used to develop digital services

## The common denominator

All digital projects should start with the end user. This simple principle is foundational to designing, developing, and delivering digital services. In fact, “Understand what people need” is the first play in the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.usds.gov/), which you will explore as you progress through this module.

### Discussion: The good, the bad, and the ugly (optional)
>Note for vendors: this is an optional self-paced learning activity in the LMS.

- What commercial companies or government agencies do you know of that keep user needs at the forefront? How does this show? What steps do you think they took to get to where they are?
- What commercial companies or government agencies do you know of that didn’t prioritize user needs? What were the consequences?

Post in the discussion topic which companies or agencies you chose and why. 

## Strategies for keeping focused on the end user

![UX Designer Paradox - Comic with three frames: The first frame is "What we dream up at kickoff" with a detailed rocket plan; the second frame is "What we settle for at launch" with a less extravagant plan of the rocket; the third frame is "What the user needs" with a bike and ramp](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/ux-design-paradox-comic_lg_source%202.jpg "Strategies from Play 1 of the U.S. Digital Service Playbook can help avoid this scenario.") 

Here are some strategies from [Play 1](https://playbook.usds.gov/#play1) of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook to help keep you focused on the user's needs. Note that this list is not all-inclusive. It is a starting point that you will build on throughout your learning journey.

__Do your research__

- Spend time with current and prospective users of the service.
- Do more than just interview; use qualitative and quantitative research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent.
- Before the digital service is built, test prototypes on real people.
- As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people’s needs.

__Document and share your findings__

- Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences.
- Share findings with the team and agency leadership.

__Prioritize development tasks based on user needs__

- Create a prioritized list of tasks the user is trying to accomplish, also known as user stories.

Next, let's examine a few techniques that can help you implement the strategies listed in Play 1. 

**Learn about your users’ needs**

Depending on the type of digital service being developed and the organization, you will hear about one or all of the following techniques for learning more about your users’ needs. Here, we present you with an overview of some of these techniques. As you progress in your learning journey, you will learn more about how to implement these techniques and when each is most appropriate.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

You might think you know what your end user needs. However, starting development without testing your hypotheses could create a big headache for you and end up wasting the American taxpayer’s money. Luckily there is a way to test your hypotheses. The MVP is a core component of [Lean Startup methodology](https://theleanstartup.com/principles) developed by Eric Ries. This method focuses on delivering the smallest product possible to test hypotheses about customer needs. This should be a light-weight product, something even as simple as a wireframe or PowerPoint that outlines functionality. It just needs to be big enough for you to test your hypotheses. This can be done by the acquisition professional, program office, or through a vendor. Once you have your MVP, you solicit feedback to test your assumptions, and then document and analyze your results. As a result of your analysis, you will need to choose whether to pivot or persevere. 


| Pivot | Persevere |
| ----- | --------- |

What you validate turns into your product backlog. |

**For further exploration**

Read how the Department of Education developed a simple prototype made of cardboard and paper to test their ideas for a mobile-friendly college scorecard. They also took Play 1 to heart in other ways by talking directly to high school students and leveraging a variety of data to inform their development.  

[Behind the scenes: Building a new College Scorecard with students](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/under-the-hood-building-a-new-college-scorecard-with-students-cbcf21a745fc) 

### A/B testing

![Two different screens on a tablet, one marked A, one marked B](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/a-b_testing_2.jpg)

A/B testing is a method for developing and refining products. This method allows you to test ideas in real time. You can use this method to test even the smallest of components (e.g., layouts, wording, image, amount of text). With A/B testing, seemingly subjective decisions can now be driven by data.

### Personas

Personas are fictional characters that teams create to help understand their users. Personas are usually concise and visual, with a focus on goals and behaviors rather than tasks or job descriptions.  

![Profile of Linda who is 50 years old, Lives in Tallahassee, Florida, Widowed with no children. She needs help finding information online, easy to understand information, and financial support form the government to help pay her bills](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/USA.gov-Personas-March-2015%20Linda.jpg)


### Using personas as an anchor for development

Imagine you’re remodeling your house. It’s up to you and your spouse to decide what’s most important to include in your remodel. But there can be lots of other opinions about what’s most important. Your builder tells you about some cool new features. Your brother tells you about the latest and greatest techniques for redoing bathrooms. Your neighbor shares what worked well for them. Before you know it, you and your spouse’s preferences can easily be lost. The same thing can (and likely will!) happen during digital service projects. You can use personas as an anchor for your development decisions. Priority should always go toward efforts that will best meet user needs.

Because your personas drive development decisions, it is important that you consider personas as living documents. User needs can evolve as technology evolves. Keep your users' needs in check by leveraging research, engaging them in dialogue, and involving them in the testing of your digital product or service.

### Journey mapping

You can use journey mapping to explore users' feelings, questions, and needs as they interact with your organization and the service/product offered. Personas can also serve as a foundation for creating journey maps.

## Contemporary practices in developing digital services

Now that we’ve covered the common denominator of all digital services development, let’s explore contemporary practices outlined in the U.S. Digital Services Playbook. Take this section for what it is, a survey, not an exhaustive list, of current practices. Remember that keeping pace with current technologies takes a concerted effort. Consider this a starting point for building your digital service development know-how. 

As procurement professionals, you are critical in shaping how the government invests in digital services. Modern approaches like Agile, Human-Centered Design (HCD), and DevSecOps aren’t just buzzwords, they're proven strategies that lead to better outcomes. These methods help government teams and contractors adapt quickly to changing needs, deliver working features faster, and reduce costly rework. They also provide greater transparency into contractor performance, helping ensure taxpayer dollars are used efficiently and effectively. Understanding how these approaches work, and how to look for them in proposals, can help you support more informed acquisitions and more successful digital service projects.

### Agile foundations

**What is Agile delivery?**

Agile delivery emphasizes working code over planning and team cohesiveness over formal process. It relies on the hypothesis that iterative development, collaboration, and transparency lead to better product development. It empowers delivery teams to work in short cycles (sprints), respond to change, and continuously deliver value to users. Agile is a departure from traditional waterfall delivery, where requirements are set initially and progress is linear. Instead, Agile adapts as needs and dependencies are identified and evolve.

Key elements of Agile delivery:

* Iterative development through sprint cycles  
* Working product at the end of each sprint
* Frequent demonstration of progress via demos and reviews
* Continuous refinement and planning
* Transparency in workflows and decision-making
* Individual commitment to delivering on promised tasks
* Focus on working software over extensive documentation

Agile can be scaled across multiple teams using **SAFe** (Scaled Agile Framework), enabling disparate delivery teams to coordinate activities while working on common goals. 

**Why Agile in government?**

Before we dive into the case for Agile in government, take a few minutes to hear from Jeff Sutherland, co-creator of the Agile Manifesto. In this short TED Talk, Jeff shares how Agile started and has been used in everything from military operations to education. As you watch, consider how core principles like collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement might help federal teams deliver smarter, faster, and more user-centered digital services.

[Jeff Sutherland's TED Talk about Agile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4thQcgLCqk) 

**The case for Agile in federal digital projects**

Modern digital service delivery in government requires agility. With constantly evolving user needs, policy changes, and high expectations for speed and usability, federal agencies benefit from Agile methods that foster adaptability and transparency. 

Agile reduces procurement risk by promoting incremental delivery, increasing visibility into contractor performance, and enabling continuous stakeholder feedback. This process creates more opportunities to adjust course early, ensure alignment with mission needs, and deliver value faster.

The Agile method is distinguished from artisanal or waterfall projects by emphasizing clear communication of project goals, transparency, team collaboration over hierarchy, and documentation up front, as opposed to happening at the end of a project. Artisanal projects typically grow from a response to a particular problem and, over time, accumulate features and functions in response to new needs without any planning or documentation at all, often resulting in "spaghetti code” that creates unintended consequences down the road. 

Waterfall project management was developed to address the shortcomings of artisanal development, attempting to bound the scope of a project before work begins, and address changes and additions in a structured way. Waterfall projects rely on a rigid, linear process: define detailed requirements up front, plan and award the contract, and then move into a long development phase and make changes only through formal change orders. This approach often delays feedback until the end, when the finished product is delivered. By then, it's costly and time-consuming to make changes, even if the original requirements no longer reflect user or mission needs. Testing and course corrections are squeezed by schedule pressures, increasing the risk of delivering something that misses the mark.

### Why Agile matters:

Agile delivery enables teams to:

* Coordinate across dozens of contractor teams simultaneously  
* Deliver minimum viable products (MVPs) quickly to end users  
* Work within the scope of existing resources by continually prioritizing features to be included in the MVP, thereby preserving budgets  
* Adapt to emerging priorities and new information  
* Maintain transparency with stakeholders  
* Prioritize accessibility, security, and user-centered design  
* Empower decision makers to manage the project to budget, timeline, or feature set, and have the impact of those decisions be visible to all participants

**A shift in mindset**

Agile methods represent a cultural shift. While some federal stakeholders may be accustomed to waterfall, Agile teams demonstrate the value of iteration and user feedback by:

* Including stakeholders in backlog refinement and sprint reviews  
* Offering Agile training to support collaboration 
* Fostering trust through transparency, clear roles, and consistent delivery

[Play 4](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play4) of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook to Agile Development points away from a traditional linear software development method and toward an incremental, fast-paced development style. 

**Is there more than one approach to implementing Agile development practices?**

Search “Agile practices” and you’ll discover various approaches to implementing them. 

![Umbrella Labeled Agile with the following words under the umbrella: Extreme Programming, Scrum, Crystal, DSDM, Kanaban, FDD, Lean](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/AgilePractices%20Umbrella.png)

*Sample of Agile practices*

However, all Agile practices adhere to the values outlined in the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and illustrated in the diagram below. While the items on the right have value, Agile values the items on the left more.  

![Agile values are "Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools" "Working software over comprehensive documentation" "Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation" and "Responding to Change over following a plan"](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/AgileValues.jpg)

*Agile software development values*

**Should Agile always be the default solution for digital services or IT projects?**

You shouldn’t default to Agile development because you need digital services or IT. Many IT needs can be met with commercially available off-the-shelf items and commoditized services, such as subscription services for software licenses, with little or no development work. For example, if you must complete a simple data migration task that involves copying information from one database to another, no new development may be needed. Likewise, a commercially off-the-shelf product may be more appropriate for automating standard business processes. Agile should be used for digital service needs that require significant software design and development.

### Who’s on an Agile team?

**Agile team roles**

Each role on an Agile team has a clear function. Common roles include:

* **Product Owner (PO) / Product Manager (PdM)** – The expert who sets priorities, gathers requirements, and collaborates daily with the team.  
* **Scrum Master or Project Manager (PjM)** – Facilitates meetings, resolves impediments, and supports team flow.  
* **Developers** – Engineers who create front-end, back-end, or full-stack code, manage server platforms, and ensure code and platform integrity through continuous testing.  
* **Accessibility Specialist** – Embeds Section 508 compliance throughout development.  
* **Security & Compliance Expert** – Oversees vulnerability testing, patching, and compliance reviews.  
* **HCD Designers & Researchers** – Create designs, workflows, and prototypes based on user needs and research data, collaborate with developers to bring the designs to code, and conduct discovery and usability studies.

A well-formed Agile team includes a mix of technical, design, and product experts aligned to deliver value.

## Agile frameworks and methods

This section introduces key frameworks and practices that bring Agile to life, including Kanban and Scrum. You’ll explore how these methods support transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement through structured workflows, defined roles, and regular ceremonies that keep teams aligned and focused on delivering value.

| **Kanban** | **Scrum** |
|------------|-----------|
| Kanban is a visual workflow management method that enhances efficiency and transparency in task progression. Originating from Toyota's "just-in-time" (JIT) production system, Kanban has been adapted beyond manufacturing to various fields, including software development and government project management. | Scrum is an Agile framework for developing and sustaining complex products through iterative progress and collaboration. It emphasizes adaptability, team accountability, and continuous improvement. |
| **Key elements of Kanban include:** <br><br> - **Visual boards**: Tasks are represented as cards on a board, moving through columns that denote workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). <br> - **Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits**: Limiting the number of tasks in each stage prevents overloading and highlights bottlenecks. <br> - **Flow Metrics**: Metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and throughput provide insights into process efficiency and help in continuous improvement. <br><br> Modern Kanban implementations also utilize tools like cumulative flow diagrams and control charts to monitor workflow stability and identify areas for enhancement. | **Core components of Scrum include:** <br><br> - **Scrum team**: The team comprises a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers who collaborate to deliver valuable work increments. <br> - **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations (typically 1-4 weeks) during which a usable and potentially releasable product increment is created. <br> - **Ceremonies**: Structured meetings such as Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective facilitate planning, inspection, and adaptation. <br> - **Artifacts and commitments**: <br>  - - Product Backlog with the Product Goal <br>   - - Sprint Backlog with the Sprint Goal <br>   - - Increment with the Definition of Done <br><br> These elements ensure transparency and focus, guiding the team toward delivering value effectively. |


## Agile practices

| Agile Practice | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Assign a Project Manager or Scrum Master** | The Project Manager or Scrum Master acts as the operational glue. They: <br> - Communicate across stakeholders and teams <br> - Track progress and surface issues <br> - Facilitate planning and alignment <br><br> This role ensures team focus and alignment with priorities. |
| **Sprint planning, review, and retrospective** | Each sprint includes three key ceremonies: <br> - **Sprint planning** – Define what the team will accomplish and why it matters <br> - **Sprint review** – Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders <br> - **Sprint retrospective** – Reflect on process improvements <br><br> This structured rhythm enables teams to iterate and improve continuously. |
| **Daily stand-up** | Also known as “scrum,” this 15-minute daily sync keeps the team aligned. Everyone shares: <br> - What they did yesterday <br> - What they’re doing today <br> - Any blockers <br> - Any after-meetings between participants to work on problems <br><br> Stand-ups foster transparency, collaboration, and rapid issue resolution. |
| **Backlog refinement** | Backlog refinement is a collaborative session where: <br> - The Product Owner sets and adjusts priorities <br> - The Dev Team identifies dependencies, technical needs, and estimates effort <br> - Innovation and technical input are integrated into the plan <br><br> A healthy backlog is: <br> - Continuously updated <br> - Prioritized based on business value and user needs <br> - Clear on effort, dependencies, and acceptance criteria <br><br> Refinement ensures Agile responsiveness to shifting priorities, vital in the dynamic landscape of government digital services. |
| **Use an MVP approach** | A Minimum Viable Product approach means: <br> - Delivering the most critical functionality first <br> - Focusing on what 80% of users need most <br> - Reducing time-to-value while gathering feedback <br><br> This method is ideal for large-scale federal platforms with evolving needs. |
| **Integrate HCD and Lean UX methodologies** | Human-Centered Design (HCD) and Lean UX are complementary to Agile. These practices: <br> - Involve users early and often <br> - Promote iterative design based on feedback <br> - Make digital services more inclusive and intuitive <br><br> User research and usability testing reveal what users need and where they struggle. |
| **Prioritize accessibility** | Accessibility is embedded throughout Agile workflows. Practices include: <br> - Early testing against 508 standards <br> - Proactive design choices (keyboard navigation, contrast, screen reader compatibility) <br> - Inclusive user research <br> - Continuous feedback loops <br><br> This ensures government services are usable by all. |
| **Run usability tests frequently** | User feedback drives iteration. Usability testing explores: <br> - Can users find what they need? <br> - Do the menus make sense? <br> - What causes frustration? <br><br> Testing leads to actionable improvements baked directly into each sprint cycle. |
| **Combine Agile with DevOps** | DevOps keeps systems available, high performing, and secure. It supports Agile delivery through CI/CD pipelines. Practices include: <br> - Creating an auditable platform and repeatable deployment processes <br> - Automating system builds, code testing, and deployments <br> - Maintaining stability across teams and apps <br> - Supporting fast iteration while ensuring consistent code quality <br> - Minimizing regressions as new features are added |
| **Create transparency via project scaffolding** | Project scaffolding includes foundational practices, documentation, and tools supporting Agile teams: <br> - Team charters, onboarding materials, coding standards, stakeholder maps <br> - Task management systems and documentation platforms (e.g., JIRA, Confluence) <br><br> These ensure: <br> - Complete visibility into the team’s work <br> - Easy access to documentation <br> - Real-time collaboration <br><br> Transparency builds trust between contractors and federal stakeholders and improves delivery outcomes. |



### Final thoughts

Agile delivery is more than a set of practices. It's a mindset of continuous improvement, open communication, and user-centered design. By adopting these methods, federal acquisition professionals can better support digital transformation initiatives and make informed, Agile-friendly procurement decisions.

## Discussion (optional)
>Note for vendors: this is an optional self-paced learning activity in the LMS. 

Think back to a digital service or IT project you were involved in, whether as a contracting officer, program manager, or stakeholder. Based on what you now know about Agile, what might you have done differently to encourage more adaptability, feedback, or user involvement?

## Knowledge check

Question 1

**Your agency needs to replace an outdated legacy system, causing usability issues for staff and the public. The scope isn’t fully defined yet, and stakeholder needs are still being explored. What’s the best approach?**

- [ ] Use a waterfall process to define every requirement up front
- [x] Use Agile to deliver value in stages while gathering feedback
- [ ] Purchase a commercial off-the-shelf solution without further research

>Correct! Agile supports evolving needs through iteration and user feedback.
>Not quite. Since the project scope is evolving, Agile is best for delivering in stages while gathering input.

Question 2

**You’re managing a software development contract with multiple vendor teams. Which Agile practice will help ensure visibility into progress and performance?**

- [ ] Require weekly email updates  
- [x] Schedule a sprint review every 2 weeks  
- [ ] Wait for the final product demo

>Correct! Sprint reviews create regular opportunities to share progress with stakeholders.
> Close, but email updates and final demos don’t offer the same transparency and collaboration as sprint reviews.

Question 3

**Which of the following best describes a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?**

- [ ] The final, fully-featured product
- [ ] A product prototype used only for internal 
- [x] A basic version with essential features to test value quickly

>That’s right! MVPs focus on delivering core value quickly, then improving based on feedback.
>Not quite. MVPs aren’t prototypes or final products—they’re a smart way to test value early.

Question 4

**Which role primarily manages the product backlog and prioritizes user needs?**

- [ ] Scrum Master   
- [x] Product Owner     
- [ ] Developer

>Yes! The Product Owner owns the backlog and ensures the team focuses on what matters most.
>Not quite. While Scrum Masters support team flow, the Product Owner sets priorities and gathers requirements.

## Digital service delivery methods: HCD and DevSecOps

### What is HCD?

Before we build anything, we have to understand *who* we're building for. **Human-centered design (HCD)** starts by putting people at the heart of the process. In this section, you’ll see how HCD helps teams listen deeply, design with empathy, and create digital services that are not only functional but meaningful. For federal procurement professionals, understanding HCD means being equipped to assess whether vendor solutions truly center the user.

Designing under this lens means deeply understanding the needs, behaviors, and emotions of the people you are planning for. Using those insights, you can create solutions that align directly with an exceptional user experience.

![Circular diagram illustrating a human-centered design process. The outer ring is divided into three segments: "Understanding User Needs", "Designing for Their Needs", and "Getting Them Engaged". Each segment lists related activities: "Understanding User Needs" includes Quantitative Research, Qualitative Research, and Ethnography; "Designing for Their Needs" includes Usability Testing, Prototyping, and Co-Creation; "Getting Them Engaged" includes Community Engagement, Awareness & Access, and Messaging & Communication. The inner circle is labeled "Synthesizing Insights into Actions," surrounded by arrows indicating a flow from "Strategy & Assessment" on the left to "Program Design & Implementation" on the right.](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/HCD.png)


In federal digital service projects, HCD is a mindset and methodology that supports better government outcomes. By involving users early and often, HCD helps teams deliver usable and truly useful tools and services.

### Core principles of human-centered design

#### Empathy

* **Definition:**  
   Understand users' lived experiences, perspectives, and pain points. This means listening with intention and designing based on your end user, not on your assumptions.   
* **Scenario:**  
   A digital benefits platform was designed without involving real users. After launch, veterans reported frustration navigating the interface and finding key services.  
* **Lesson learned:**  
   If designers had listened to user feedback earlier, they could have prevented usability issues and improved satisfaction from the start.

#### User research

* **Definition:**  
  Engage directly with users through interviews, surveys, and observations. Use real user data to guide decisions, not assumptions. Research and discover existing solutions so you aren’t reinventing the wheel. Conduct research continuously throughout the project lifecycle.  
* **Scenario:**  
   A procurement team made key design decisions to redesign a feature without conducting user interviews on the feature first. After launch, feedback revealed that the users needed minor updates to the feature, not something completely different.   
* **Lesson learned:**  
   Direct user research helps teams avoid costly rework and builds services people want and need.

#### Iterations

* **Definition:**  
  Test ideas early, gather feedback, and refine solutions through repeated cycles. HCD and Agile go hand-in-hand by enabling rapid learning and improvement.  
* **Scenario:**  
   After months of work, a contractor delivered a polished product, only to find it unsatisfactory to end users.  
* **Lesson learned:**  
  Iterating in smaller cycles and testing early would have saved time and delivered a more usable solution.

#### Usability testing

* **Definition:**  
   Usability testing is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Watching users interact with prototypes helps identify pain points and uncover areas for improvement.  
* **Scenario:**  
   A new application was developed and launched without user testing. Post-launch feedback revealed multiple accessibility barriers and confusing workflows.  
* **Lesson learned:**  
   Frequent usability testing during development could have identified these issues early and improved the final product.

#### Design for everyone

* **Definition:**  
   Inclusive design means designing for a broad range of users. Accessibility considerations should begin early and go beyond simply meeting compliance standards.  
* **Scenario:**  
   An agency met WCAG 2.0 requirements but didn’t test with users who rely on screen readers. As a result, key tasks were still challenging to complete.  
* **Lesson learned:**  
   Truly inclusive design requires building beyond checklists—testing with real users ensures services work for everyone.

#### Collaboration

* **Definition:**  
   Human-centered design is a team effort. Success depends on input from stakeholders, engineers, project managers, and product owners, not just designers.  
* **Scenario:**  
   A project siloed the design team from developers and stakeholders. The design team created HCD designs based on user needs and testing, but because they were siloed from developers, they couldn’t affirm that their designs would work within the system constraints. The result was misaligned priorities and designs that had to be reworked, which delayed the project significantly.   
* **Lesson learned:**  
   Cross-functional collaboration leads to shared understanding, better decisions, and smoother delivery.

For procurement professionals, understanding HCD is key to evaluating whether a contractor or solution is truly user-focused. It also informs the type of research, testing, and iteration expectations that should be baked into solicitations and performance metrics.

##  HCD in government

**Designing for people: human-centered design in government**

Human-centered design in government is more than just a process. It’s a mindset that prioritizes the people who use federal services. In contrast to traditional development methods focusing on policy or system constraints, HCD puts user needs at the forefront. This means engaging real users early and often, listening to their challenges, and designing intuitive, inclusive, and effective solutions.

When applied to federal programs and services, HCD helps ensure that digital tools are functional, equitable, and accessible to all, regardless of ability, language, location, or digital literacy. Accessibility considerations, such as compliance with Section 508, are built into the design process rather than tacked on at the end. HCD also emphasizes continuous feedback and iteration, which means solutions evolve to better meet changing user needs.

Using HCD, government teams can reduce waste, improve public trust, and create services that truly work for the people they intend to serve.

When used effectively, HCD reduces barriers, simplifies complex processes, and builds trust between the government and the public.

### Real world examples:

**1\. VA.gov Redesign – Department of Veterans Affairs**

The VA undertook a comprehensive redesign of VA.gov to improve the digital experience for Veterans. By employing HCD principles, they focused on understanding Veterans' needs and behaviors, leading to a more intuitive and accessible website. This approach resulted in increased user satisfaction and trust in VA services.

## DevSecOps explained

**Making delivery fast and secure: DevSecOps in government**

DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It’s a modern approach to building and delivering secure software, servers, and digital services by integrating security into every step of the process.

In traditional government IT projects, development, security review, and operations often happen in separate silos, which can lead to delays, miscommunications, and vulnerabilities. Usually, these tasks are completed manually, creating possibilities for human error. DevSecOps is a framework that breaks down those silos by creating mechanisms to automate system and code deployment and maintenance tasks. Automation significantly reduces the possibility of human error and speeds up deployment tasks. Instead of waiting until the end to test for vulnerabilities, DevSecOps integrates automated security checks into every step of the process. This includes code reviews, server configuration and deployment, network hardening, vulnerability, and compliance scans that are triggered anytime a change is made to a system.

![Diagram illustrating the 'New Way' of DevOps, showing a continuous, circular flow of Code, Build, Test, Release, and Operate, with a central team of developers.](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/raw/8f3e293242f3e2cbfa72b51da4263da664fccac8/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/Module-1-Media/DevOps%20the%20new%20way.png)


*What is DevOps from [https://medium.com/strategio/devops-a-harmonious-movement-1380e03e5bdd](https://medium.com/strategio/devops-a-harmonious-movement-1380e03e5bdd)* 

Another key feature of DevSecOps is the **CI/CD pipeline**, which stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This process enables teams to make small, frequent updates to software and get those updates into production quickly. This allows developers to respond faster to user needs and fix problems without waiting for a big release. Ultimately, the ability to rapidly make code changes to the production environment improves stability and fosters confidence in the development team. For federal digital services, new features, bug fixes, and updates can be delivered faster and with fewer errors while meeting the government’s strict security and compliance standards.

Ultimately, DevSecOps helps agencies build **faster, safer, and more** **reliable software**—all critical needs in today's high-stakes digital government environment.

**Playbook integration:** CI/CD pipelines and DevSecOps practices help federal teams **ship faster and safer**, making digital services more responsive and secure.

**Why DevSecOps matters on federal projects**

In federal projects, DevSecOps supports mission-critical services by ensuring they are stable, scalable, and responsive to change, all while maintaining code quality, security, and accessibility compliance, and reducing the costs associated with traditional code deployment methods. Speed, stability, and security aren’t optional in complex government systems—they're essential. DevSecOps helps federal agencies meet these demands by:

* Automating code deployments and testing, reducing manual errors  
* Speeding up the delivery of new features without compromising security  
* Maintaining robust, compliant systems with ongoing monitoring  
* Supporting secure data handling and backups

### Real world example:

**Spotlight: How the VA used DevSecOps to modernize Veteran services**

In recent years, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has undergone a sweeping modernization effort to improve digital services for millions of Veterans. Faced with aging IT systems and slow delivery cycles, the agency needed a new approach—one that could increase speed, enhance security, and reduce waste—the solution: DevSecOps.

DevSecOps enabled the VA to embed security into every step of the software delivery process. Instead of treating security as a final checkpoint, teams initially integrated automated testing, security scanning, and compliance monitoring into their development pipelines.

Before adopting DevSecOps, releasing new features or updates often took months and required coordination across siloed teams. After the shift, the VA deployed automated CI/CD pipelines and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), allowing for faster, more reliable releases. The agency began pushing out updates in days—or even hours—without compromising quality or compliance.

The cultural shift was just as significant as the technical changes. Developers, operations personnel, and security experts worked together in cross-functional teams. This collaboration helped break down silos and ensured that everyone shared responsibility for delivering secure, user-friendly services.

Procurement also played a vital role. Contracting officers and 1102s supported the shift by drafting performance-based contracts encouraging iterative delivery, Agile teaming, and real-time performance monitoring. This allowed the VA to hold vendors accountable while enabling innovation and rapid response to changing user needs.

The outcome? Veterans gained access to faster, more reliable digital tools, such as online benefits tracking, streamlined appointment scheduling, and real-time support services.

The VA’s journey highlighted a key lesson for acquisition professionals: enabling DevSecOps through innovative procurement strategies leads to better software and outcomes for government customers.

## Design \+ DevSecOps: The power combo

**Better together: HCD and DevSecOps in action**

While HCD and DevSecOps are powerful, they become even more effective when used together. Consider this: **“Design is the compass, and DevSecOps is the engine.”** HCD ensures you're building the right thing people need, while DevSecOps helps you build it quickly, securely, and reliably.

Together, these approaches support Agile delivery by enabling fast feedback loops, inclusive design practices, and secure deployment pipelines. HCD drives the vision by collecting insights from real users and translating them into meaningful features. Meanwhile, DevSecOps ensures those features are built and released efficiently, securely, compliantly, and scalably.

This combination is particularly valuable in the federal context. It allows agencies to deliver digital services that meet the high expectations of today’s users while also navigating the complex requirements of government regulations, security, and accessibility. When teams use both practices in tandem, they can deliver **more innovative,** **safer, and user-friendly** digital services on time and on budget.

**Visual:** An illustrated metaphor: A ship with HCD as the navigator (compass) and DevSecOps as the engine room crew. Both are essential to reach the destination: user-centered, reliable digital services.

**Playbook integration:** Federal teams use HCD to **guide direction** and DevSecOps to **power execution**, ensuring that services are aligned with user needs while being scalable and secure.

## Knowledge check 

Prompt: You’re working with a federal team building a new mobile app for Veterans to track their healthcare appointments.

✅ Question 1

Which approach should you prioritize first?

[[ ]] Use DevSecOps to begin coding and automating deployments immediately.
[[X]] Apply HCD practices to understand Veteran needs and gather early feedback.
[[ ]] Begin procurement for security and operations tools.

---

Feedback:

* **Correct:** ✅ Applying Human-Centered Design (HCD) first helps you understand Veteran needs before building. This ensures you’re solving the right problems. DevSecOps and procurement can follow once the team knows what to build and why.  

* **Incorrect:** ❌ Not quite. Understanding user needs through HCD should come first. DevSecOps supports the delivery once the team knows what to build and why.


## Digital service delivery providers - Sources of supply  

**The government ecosystem**

Many federal agencies now have internal digital service teams dedicated to transforming and modernizing digital services. One example is the U.S. DOGE Service (USDS), which focuses on building human-centered, Agile digital services, often in collaboration with agency teams and external partners. 

Internal digital service teams are embedded within agencies and vary in size, mission, and approach. They bring technical expertise in-house and help ensure services are built with users in mind and delivered iteratively.

These teams play a critical role in:

* **Modernizing legacy systems** by promoting Agile, iterative development  
* **Prioritizing user needs** through human-centered design (HCD)  
* **Improving procurement practices** by advising on modular contracting and vendor selection  
* **Supporting delivery** by embedding with program teams to guide implementation or act as product owners

## Models of collaboration

Collaboration between federal and vendor teams takes many forms. Choosing the right model depends on the scope, budget, risk tolerance, and speed of delivery.

Common models include:

- **Staff augmentation** – Individual vendor staff join federal teams to fill skill gaps.
- **Full team delivery** – Vendors deliver entire workstreams or products independently.
- **Co-delivery / Hybrid teams** – Vendor and federal staff collaborate as one integrated team, often with shared responsibilities.


### Real examples of “Who does what”

Hybrid delivery models are increasingly common in digital service work. These models depend on **clear role definitions**, strong communication, and a shared understanding of outcomes.

**Example scenarios:**

* A small vendor handles user research and prototyping, while the agency maintains backend integration.  
* A large integrator leads DevSecOps operations while a digital consultancy handles UX/UI and front-end development.  
* A digital services company partners with an internal federal team to co-develop a modular CMS platform, sharing sprint planning and product ownership duties.
