## Evaluation Criteria Overview 

### I. Phases of Agile Acquisition

Agile acquisitions, like traditional federal procurement approaches, begin with a clearly defined need, market research, and an analysis of alternatives. However, once an acquisition strategy is selected, the agile approach diverges sharply, favoring flexibility, collaboration, and iterative validation.

**1. Show Don’t Tell**

Agile acquisition prioritizes objective-level requirements, focusing on the “what” over the “how.” It values working products over exhaustive documentation, aligning with agile delivery principles and user-centered outcomes. Selection methodologies emphasize a “show, don’t tell” model. Consequently, solicitations often include past experience as a technical evaluation factor distinct from past performance:

* **Past Performance** evaluates a vendor’s ability to meet contract requirements, based on size, scope, and duration.  
* **Past Experience** focuses on *what* was delivered and *how*, reflecting technical capabilities and innovation in execution.

---
    
**2\. Down-Select Process**

Agile acquisitions commonly use a multi-phased evaluation approach, or down-select, to streamline the source selection process:

* Offerors submit minimal, early-phase deliverables (e.g., white papers).  
* Government teams assess basic qualifications and alignment.  
* Uncompetitive vendors are released early, minimizing industry bid and proposal costs while reducing the likelihood of protest.

---
   
**3\. Interactive Evaluation**  
  Subsequent phases involve interactive exchanges with shortlisted vendors. These may include:  
* Technical demonstrations  
* Solution walkthroughs  
* Team presentations or problem-solving sessions

This interaction provides evaluators with real-time insight into the offeror’s solution maturity, team culture, and collaboration capabilities, departing from the static, written-only approaches of traditional source selection.

---
**4\. Collaborative Negotiation**

Once a preferred vendor is identified, the government may conduct alpha contracting or collaborative negotiations. Together, the government and vendor co-develop:

* Performance Work Statement (PWS)  
* Implementation plan  
* Quality assurance metrics

--- 
**5\. Type of Evaluation: Comparative Evaluation vs. Best-Value Trade-Off**

Selecting the appropriate evaluation approach is crucial for ensuring alignment with the acquisition’s goals, the complexity of the solution space, and the nature of the risk being managed. Two common approaches in federal procurement are comparative evaluation and best-value trade-off.

**Comparative Evaluation Approach**

Comparative evaluation focuses on assessing the relative merits of each proposal. It enables flexibility and adaptability, making it especially suitable for streamlined acquisitions under FAR Parts 8.4, 12, and 13.5.

* Strengths:

  * Enables side-by-side comparison of proposal features  
  * Supports flexibility and efficiency  
  * Aligns well with oral presentations, technical demonstrations, and down-select phases

* Use Cases:

  * Agile software development  
  * Commercial solutions under schedules or simplified acquisition  
  * Rapid prototyping with evolving technical requirements  
      
**Best-Value Trade-Off**

The best-value trade-off method is used to balance price and non-price evaluation factors, particularly in complex acquisitions under FAR Parts 15 and 16\.

* Strengths:

  * Facilitates well-documented decision-making  
  * Justifies award to higher-rated but higher-priced proposals  
  * Suitable for high-risk or mission-critical programs
 
* Use Cases:
  
  * Complex product/service acquisitions  
  * Situations where value-added differentiation justifies cost

Example Adjectival Evaluation Scale:

| Rating | Definition |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Excellent** | **Proposal exceeds requirements in a way that benefits the government; very low risk** |
| **Good** | **Proposal meets requirements and offers some added value; low risk** |
| **Acceptable** | **Proposal meets minimum requirements; moderate risk** |
| **Marginal** | **Proposal has deficiencies; high risk if award is made** |
| **Unacceptable** | **Proposal fails to meet minimum requirements; ineligible for award** |



**Selecting the Right Approach**

Comparative evaluation is well-suited for agile and innovative procurements that require flexibility and iterative engagement. Best-value trade-offs are most effective in structured, high-value acquisitions where traceability and documentation are crucial. Hybrid models may be used to apply comparative methods during early phases (e.g., white papers or demos) and best-value during final evaluations.

---
### II. Evaluation Criteria: Purpose and Best Practices

**Purpose of Evaluation Criteria**

Evaluation criteria are the cornerstone of any well-structured source selection process. They define what the government values most in a solution and shape how proposals are assessed in a fair, transparent, and mission-aligned manner, particularly in agile acquisitions, where adaptability, team dynamics, and iterative delivery are crucial. In such cases criteria must go beyond traditional compliance checks and instead reflect real-world performance and user outcomes.

**Well-designed criteria serve multiple purposes:**

1. **Ensure Transparency and Fairness**  
   Clear, pre-established criteria promote a level playing field, reducing ambiguity for vendors and minimizing the risk of disputes or protests.

2. **Drive Objectivity in Evaluation**  
   By focusing on observable behaviors, demonstrable capabilities, and measurable outcomes, criteria reduce bias and promote consistent scoring across evaluation teams.

3. **Support Efficient Decision-Making**  
   Thoughtful criteria streamline proposal reviews, helping acquisition teams quickly differentiate between high-value and lower-value proposals—especially important in down-select processes.

4. **Enable Accountability and Auditability**  
   Traceable evaluation decisions reinforce the integrity of the procurement process and support post-award justification and oversight.

5. **Maximize Value for Money**  
   Criteria that reflect mission priorities—such as usability, speed to value, or innovation—help ensure award decisions result in the best return on investment, not just the lowest cost.

6. **Facilitate Risk Management**  
   Evaluation categories can directly assess a vendor’s ability to manage delivery risk, such as their approach to continuous integration, agile planning, or incident response.

7. **Reinforce Public Confidence**  
   A well-documented and defensible evaluation process builds trust among vendors and the broader public in the integrity of federal acquisitions.

8. **Mitigate Legal and Procedural Risk**  
   Properly structured evaluation criteria that align with the FAR and applicable policies reduce the risk of procedural challenges or post-award protests.

In short, evaluation criteria are not a formality—they are a strategic tool for ensuring that the selected solution and vendor are best positioned to deliver on the government’s objectives under real-world conditions.

---
### III. Selecting Appropriate Evaluation Criteria

Selecting the right evaluation criteria is both a technical and strategic task. It requires balancing regulatory compliance, mission needs, and market realities while supporting a fair and defensible acquisition outcome. The following best practices can guide that process:

1. **Understand the Requirement Deeply**  
   Begin with a clear, user-centered understanding of the problem space. What outcomes are desired? Who will use the solution? What does success look like? Translate these into criteria that evaluate whether a proposed solution can achieve the desired outcomes.

2. **Align with Procurement Objectives**  
   Ensure that the criteria reflect the procurement’s most important dimensions, whether that’s speed to deploy, innovation, total cost of ownership, or future maintainability. Not every criterion needs equal weight.

3. **Engage Cross-Functional Stakeholders Early**  
   Collaborate with technical experts, end-users, legal advisors, security professionals, and finance leads to define criteria that are practical, comprehensive,  and defensible from all angles. This engagement builds consensus and reduces surprises during evaluation.

4. **Categorize and Prioritize Criteria**  
   Group evaluation factors into logical categories, such as Technical, Management, Past Performance, and Cost. Within these, distinguish between:

   * **Mandatory Requirements:** Non-negotiables the solution must meet.

   * **Desirable Attributes:** Value-added capabilities that enhance the solution but aren’t strictly required.

5. **Assign Weights Based on Mission Impact**  
   Use a weighted scoring system to reflect the relative importance of each criterion. A solution's intuitive user experience might warrant more weight than a marginal cost difference, for example.

6. **Make Criteria Specific and Measurable**  
   Avoid vague language. Use measurable thresholds or examples. Instead of "has relevant experience," say "has implemented three or more similar solutions for federal clients in the past five years."

7. **Ensure Regulatory Alignment**  
   Validate all criteria against applicable sections of the FAR, especially those governing competitive procedures, evaluation factors for award, and past performance assessments.

8. **Distinguish Past Performance from Past Experience**

   * **Past Performance** assesses a vendor’s track record of meeting contractual obligations—i.e., were they reliable?

   * **Past Experience** evaluates their actual technical work—what did they build, and how well did it meet the need?

9. **Choose the Right Evaluation Methodology**  
    Match the methodology to the acquisition’s complexity and goals. Use:

   * Pass/Fail for threshold requirements,  
   * Point Scales for nuanced scoring,  
   * Comparative Evaluation for streamlined, side-by-side judgments, or  
   * Best-Value Trade-Offs when balancing cost and quality in complex procurements.

10. **Pilot and Calibrate Your Criteria**  
     Test your criteria against sample proposals to ensure they work as intended. Look for scoring ambiguity, overlaps, or unintended incentives.

11. **Refine Criteria Based on Feedback**  
     After the award, gather feedback from both vendors and evaluators to improve the criteria for future use. Ask: Did the criteria surface meaningful distinctions? Were the scoring rubrics usable and fair?

In agile environments, where collaboration, adaptability, and working software are paramount, evaluation criteria should reward vendors who demonstrate team maturity, technical fluency, and alignment with end-user needs, preferably in real time through oral presentations or working prototypes.

## Negotiating with Vendors

### Introduction

In traditional federal acquisitions, there’s a perception that opening negotiations during a solicitation:

* Adds unnecessary time  
* Increases the risk of protests  
* Doesn’t meaningfully improve outcomes

For digital services procurements, these assumptions are myths.

Digital service acquisitions differ — they rely on effective **communication, transparency, and collaboration** with vendors to deliver the best outcomes.

In digital procurements:

* **Negotiations** at the right time prevent misunderstandings and save time in the long run.

* **Strategic discussions** build trust, which is crucial for high-risk, agile projects.

* **Early negotiations** can clear up incomplete information in proposals.

* You don’t have to negotiate with everyone — focus on top-ranked vendors to sharpen competition and speed up award.

**Key benefits of early negotiations:**

* Reduce protest risk by clarifying proposal gaps

* Correct misunderstandings before the award

* Test vendor flexibility and responsiveness

* Improve technical outcomes by getting the best — not just “good enough” — proposals

In digital services procurements, negotiations are not an optional afterthought — they are a vital part of selecting the right partner.

### What are negotiations?  

The FAR defines **negotiations** as:

“Exchanges between the Government and offerors undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.”

Negotiations differ from:

* **Clarifications** – Minor corrections or explanations; proposals are not revised  
* **Communications** – Used to establish a competitive range; proposals still not revised

Negotiations can be conducted in both sole-source and competitive acquisitions. 

In **sole-source** acquisitions, the FAR uses “negotiations.” In **competitive** ones, it uses “discussions.”

In this lesson, we will use the term “negotiations” to apply to both situations.

The primary purpose of the source selection process is to allow the Government to choose the offer that represents the best value — to select the offer that best meets the Government’s needs at a fair and reasonable price. Contract negotiations are a way to maximize the ability to obtain the best value. 

### Best Practices for Digital Service Procurements 

* **Negotiate Early, Especially at Down-Selects:** Use advisory notices as a structured opportunity to open meaningful, time-boxed negotiations.

* **Focus Negotiations on Top Candidates:** Don't waste time trying to negotiate with every vendor — invest effort where there's a real potential for improvement.

* **Treat Discussions as Mutual Vetting:** You're not just evaluating vendors — you’re letting vendors evaluate the government’s approach and constraints.

* **Resolve Misaligned Assumptions:** Address gaps and misunderstandings now. It's exponentially harder to fix after a contract award.

* **Prepare Vendors for Iterative/Agile Contracts:** Many vendors are still transitioning to truly iterative delivery. Discuss expectations for backlog ownership, minimum viable products (MVPs), and iterative releases.

### Negotiation Opportunities During Challenges

In today's digital services procurements, solicitations increasingly involve **multi-phase evaluations,** such as:

* Ad initial phase to review case studies, past performance, videos, or other pass/fail methods.  
* Code challenges, live technical demonstrations, or interview-style oral presentations.  
* Moving forward with only the highest-rated vendors to the full documentation/ technical proposal stage. 

At advisory or other down-select points, negotiations can be included at multiple phases. They might make sense at the point of making selection determinations, especially if there are companies that are close to making it but missing a few points that eliminate them:

* Open discussions with vendors before eliminating them. 

* Provide vendors with feedback that helps them understand why they are not advancing.

* Offer borderline vendors a chance to strengthen their proposals if they are invited to continue.

This mirrors how agile development itself works — an iterative process of improvement based on feedback. It also builds vendor-government trust before award, aligning expectations and reducing post-award friction.

#### Example: Negotiation Opportunity During Code Challenge Phase

An agency issues an RFQ for an Agile web development team. After evaluating initial written submissions:

* Five vendors move to a code challenge phase.  
* Two vendors show strong technical proficiency but their code reveals architecture assumptions that conflict with the agency's goals (e.g., assuming the use of a commercial cloud service when the agency requires FedRAMP Moderate baseline compliance).

Rather than eliminating them immediately, the agency opens brief discussions:

* Explaining the misalignment.  
* Allowing vendors to clarify or adjust their approach in a final proposal revision.

As a result, one vendor substantially improves their design and security posture, becoming a strong finalist for award — and both the vendor and the Government avoid a potential costly misstep.

### Negotiations and Best Value 

It is important to note that negotiations are not necessarily about obtaining the lowest possible price. The goal of negotiations is to achieve best value — the most advantageous offer consistent with the acquisition’s needs and evaluation factors. Areas under negotiation may vary considerably based on the specifics of the acquisition; in addition to price, the government may negotiate technical requirements, schedule, contract type, or terms of a proposed contract. 

**For example:** 

An agency requires a sensor that uses new, cutting-edge technology. The agency anticipates a high level of performance risk; therefore, while price is an important factor, the focus of negotiations will be on technical factors and expertise. The negotiations may involve tradeoffs among price, reducing performance risk, or achieving a higher level of performance. 

**A Note About Using Price Effectively in Proposal Evaluations**

In digital service acquisitions, price should be evaluated as part of a broader assessment, not in isolation. The lowest price does not always represent the best value, especially when high-quality talent and iterative problem-solving are essential. Instead, price should serve as a check on the vendor's understanding of the work and their ability to deliver effectively.

Best value does not mean choosing the cheapest option. It means selecting the proposal that offers the most advantageous balance of technical quality, delivery risk, and cost. Evaluators should determine whether the proposed price is realistic, considering the scope and complexity of the project. A price that appears unusually low may signal that the vendor lacks a clear understanding of the work or plans to staff it with underqualified personnel, which can increase risk and lead to costly rework.

Rather than letting price drive the decision, it should be used to assess whether the vendor’s approach is credible and efficient. In a best-value tradeoff, the **technical rating carries more weight**, especially in digital services where outcomes are directly tied to the skill and collaboration of the delivery team. **Proposals that offer significantly better technical approaches may justify a higher cost, particularly if they reduce long-term risk or improve mission outcomes.**

To support this, the government can use a price range in the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) that reflects market rates for experienced digital teams. This helps identify proposals that are either unrealistically low or disproportionately high in relation to the expected value.



### Applicable Requirements and Guidance 

Negotiations are subject to a number of formal rules based on regulations, laws, and policies.  

The FAR states that the Contracting Officer (CO), at a minimum, must conduct negotiations with each offeror still under consideration for award. Negotiations must be meaningful and fair. This does not mean the CO must address the same issues with each offeror. 

Because of differences in proposals, negotiations may result in an extensive dialog with one offeror and a much briefer one with another. In either case, however, you must treat each offeror equitably.

###  Unique Aspects of Negotiations for Digital Services

When acquiring digital services, the Government needs to think and buy differently. As an example: The traditional model in which the Government owns or manages capital resources doesn’t apply with cloud services. Rather, cloud contracting is based on a consumption model, on paying for resources used on-demand.  In digital services, a number of acquisition issues have emerged, and obviously, these can impact negotiations.  

When entering negotiations in a digital services context, teams should actively focus on:

* **Technical Assumptions:** Identify assumptions embedded in vendor proposals, especially around hosting, security, scaling, and stakeholder availability.

* **Demonstration Gaps:** Use insights from code challenges or demos to clarify performance expectations or technical design choices.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Discuss approaches to areas identified as high-risk during earlier phases.

* **Scalability and Future Flexibility:** Ensure vendors understand future growth expectations even if immediate scope is small.

* **Data Rights and IP Terms:** Negotiate critical terms about custom code ownership, licensing, and portability up front.

* **Transparency and Team Dynamics:** Observe how vendors handle feedback — a strong predictor of how collaborative they will be during delivery.

### Key Strategies for Successful Negotiations with Vendors

Here are some key strategies for successfully negotiating with vendors during the solicitation process.

#### Success Strategy \#1: Use a Team Approach

Acquisition is a team-based process. From the earliest stages, acquisition personnel work as a team to develop the initial requirement, conduct market research, and identify criteria and processes that will be used to select the most favorable solution. To achieve the best value for the Government, this team-based approach should continue in contract negotiations. 

The negotiation team should include key members who were involved in defining requirements, developing the source selection process, and performing the evaluation. To ensure the necessary expertise, there should be representation of all key functional disciplines, including program and contracting staff, cost/price and other financial analysts, legal counsel, and technical experts.

#### Success Strategy \#2: Establish Negotiation Objectives

Negotiation objectives establish the Government’s initial negotiation position. The specific objectives are based on results of the team’s analysis of proposals, taking into consideration all pertinent information from the technical evaluation. With respect to cost/price proposals, objectives consider the Independent Government Cost Estimate, price history, fact finding, and audit reports. 

Because negotiation objectives will be different for each proposal, the CO should establish negotiation objectives for each offer/offeror.

As part of establishing negotiation objectives, the team should:

* Identify “must-haves.”

Based on what is important to the program office who has established the requirements, the team should determine in advance what the agency can and cannot live with. For example: The proposed labor rates for program developers are at full GSA Schedule contract rates; however, for similar acquisitions, the offeror traditionally discounts those Schedule rates by 30%. The must-have would be to secure discounts equal to or better than 30%. Another example: An offeror fails to provide subject matter experts to serve as part of the software development team. The Government feels that such expertise is a must-have. As such, this becomes a negotiation objective.

* Clearly define and document possible "tradeoffs."

To attain the best possible overall solution, negotiations often involve tradeoffs. There may be technical aspects of the solution that are so attractive the PM is willing to pay more. For example: An offeror proposes that 80% of transactions are processed within a standard timeframe. The PM prefers a rate of 90% or greater, but realizes that this higher rate will result in a higher price. While the higher rate is technically beneficial, the PM needs to consider if the tradeoff is worth it — if the higher benefit is worth the higher cost. 

* Identify and document any deficiencies and significant weaknesses that need to be discussed with the offeror. 

  o   A “deficiency” is a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement, or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.

  o   A “significant weakness” is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. The CO should consider discussing any weakness that, if addressed, could materially enhance:

  1. The proposal’s potential for award; and  
  2. The likelihood of the Government receiving the best possible solution.

Identifying must-haves, tradeoffs, deficiencies, and significant weaknesses positions the Government to establish effective negotiation objectives. For example: Let’s say that in evaluating proposals for Agile development, the team notes that an offeror has proposed sprints of very long duration and limited use of a subject matter expert. The team sees both issues as significant weaknesses. As a result, the team’s negotiation objectives include having the offeror change its approach to sprints and provide the expert on a full-time basis. While this will probably increase the price to some degree, the team sees the technical benefits as worth the change in cost.

Once negotiation objectives are established, the team should review and reach a consensus on them. The CO then prepares the pre-negotiation memorandum and obtains any approvals consistent with agency policy.

#### Success Strategy \#3: Arrange for Logistics

It is important to address logistical considerations prior to conducting negotiation sessions.

|  | Logistical Considerations |

When planning a time, consider the availability of all required Government personnel and offeror personnel. Allow enough lead time for both parties to assemble their teams. Consider the depth and breadth of the issues that will be covered, and allow reasonable time for discussion. This could be a couple hours for smaller acquisitions to a week or more for significant programs. |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f09c9e5d26ada1e17c911bf401125dc40609fc6b/Media/Module%203/arrange%20location.gif) | **Arrange for a Location**  <br> If the negotiation session will be face to face, arrange for a location. Generally, the Government will want to hold the session at its own site. However, there may be reasons to use a neutral site. (Conducting negotiations at the offeror’s location is generally considered the least desirable alternative.) Consider and prepare for related requirements, such as room size, seating capacity, and internet access.  In addition to conducting the negotiation session face to face, it may also be held via phone, video conference, or web meeting. |
|![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f09c9e5d26ada1e17c911bf401125dc40609fc6b/Media/Module%203/invite%20participants.gif)  | **Invite Appropriate Participants**  <br>It is extremely important that the Government have experienced, qualified people in attendance. Offerors will ask questions about revisions and their impacts, and the Government must have the right people to field these questions. Secure the support of the experts you think you may need, and avoid inviting people only because they are available. It is generally advisable to ask the offeror in advance who will be attending from its firm. This allows the Government to match expertise. For example, if the offeror is bringing legal experts to discuss intellectual property issues and licensing, the Government can ensure it has its counterparts at the meeting. In addition, if necessary/appropriate, the Government can place limits on the number of participants. |
| ![ ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/f09c9e5d26ada1e17c911bf401125dc40609fc6b/Media/Module%203/draft%20materials.gif) | **Draft and Distribute Read-Ahead Materials**  <br>The Government should prepare and distribute a written agenda to all participants. The agenda should include items to be discussed and background information substantiating the Government’s position, if available.  In most instances, the agenda and any other read-ahead materials should be provided so the offeror has time to review them and be prepared to respond. |



#### Success Strategy \#4: Prepare the Team for the Negotiation Sessions

Prior to conducting negotiations, the team should prepare thoroughly. Each member should have a clear understanding of:

* The requirement and the solicitation  
* The source selection processes and evaluation factors/criteria outlined in the solicitation  
* The Independent Cost Estimate/Independent Government Cost Estimate, how it was prepared, and the budgeted amount available  
* The negotiation objectives for the specific negotiation session

Normally, the CO conducts negotiations, but it will be necessary for other Government team members to participate and answer questions as needed. As a result, the CO should ensure that each member understands their role and when they should respond to a contractor’s questions. In addition, the CO should ensure that each member understands what can and should be discussed and what should *not*. 

In preparation for the negotiation session(s), the CO should ensure that at least one team member will document the discussions. These notes will be provided as a summary to the offeror as a follow-up to the negotiations. To ensure accuracy, all team members should be encouraged to take their own notes as well. 

A best practice is … to practice. Rehearse with dry runs and mock negotiations so the entire team is well prepared and confident.

#### Success Strategy \#5: Adopt a Win-Win Attitude

The primary objective of negotiations is to maximize the Government’s ability to obtain best value. Keep this objective in mind.  

When conducting negotiations, encourage two-way communication and remain flexible in reaching compromises. It can be easy to lose sight of issues that may introduce risks to the contractor, add extra work or requirements, or require additional steps in performance. For example: When offering cloud computing services, it is a standard industry practice to bill the purchaser for resources consumed on a monthly basis. As such, providers track data on a monthly basis. However, the agency PM wants usage data tracked on a *daily* basis and wants the monthly projections updated *weekly*, even though actual usage is stable across the month. Providing the data the PM wants will require a major investment by the offeror. 

When negotiating for commercial services or products, keep in mind that any custom government-specific requirements — such as certifications, compliance standards, or performance metrics beyond what is typically offered commercially — are likely to drive up costs. It’s important to ensure that any items raised during negotiations are truly justifiable and mission-critical, rather than “nice-to-haves” or requirements that don’t align with the nature of the service or product being procured.

Other tips for conducting effective negotiations:  

**DO**

* Acknowledge the positive aspects of the proposal.  
* Ensure the discussions are “meaningful” — that you identify deficiencies and significant weaknesses and discuss the specific areas that require revision or modification. Make sure the offeror fully understands the Government’s concerns.   
*  Use language that is simple and commonly understood. The offeror may not understand agency-specific acronyms or jargon.  
*  If you don’t understand something, ask for clarification. Don’t make assumptions based on what you *think* you’ve heard.  
*  Follow the agenda. Make sure every item has been adequately addressed.  
*  Be fair, rational, and professional. 

**DON'T** 

* Play power games. This does not make the Government look good or promote goodwill with industry.  
* Allow the offeror to take control of discussions.  
*  Reveal the Government’s position on price.  
*  Disclose any information about another offeror and/or another offeror's proposal. 

#### Success Strategy \#6: Follow Up as Appropriate

Once negotiations have concluded, several follow-up actions may occur:  

* The Government may eliminate an offeror from further consideration because it no longer is considered part of the competitive range.    
  * The CO confirms the negotiations in writing with each offeror and requests a final proposal revision. The revised proposal reflects all changes the offeror agreed to in the course of the negotiations.  
  * After the Government receives the final proposal revisions, the evaluation team reconvenes and revises previous evaluation findings.   
  * Finally, a source is selected for contract award.

### Conclusion

Negotiations can be daunting, but with planning and preparation, you can navigate the process with ease. Remember, at its core, negotiation is the process of coming to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions of a proposed contract with regard to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other contract terms. A successful negotiation results in a meeting of the minds, and a mutually agreeable solution.

## The Art of the Post-Evaluation Feedback in Digital Services Procurements

Generally, offerors spend a considerable amount of time and money to bid on a contract. When they are unsuccessful, they deserve to know why. Post-evaluation feedback is a critical part of this process.

Quality feedback — whether through a formal debrief or informal explanation — helps companies learn, improve future bids, and strengthens trust between government and industry, especially in digital service acquisitions.

**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Define debriefings and other post-evaluation feedback methods  
* Recognize the benefits of effective feedback  
* Describe tools and techniques used to prepare for and deliver feedback

## Why It Matters

In modern acquisitions — especially digital services — post-evaluation feedback is essential.

* Offerors invest time and resources into proposals  
* Clear, fair explanations help them improve and stay engaged  
* Vague or defensive responses increase the risk of protests  
* Digital vendors expect transparency and speed  
* Poorly handled feedback drives top firms away

Digital companies expect transparency and speed. The private tech sector is used to feedback loops and open communication. A slow, vague, defensive, or non-existent explanation of decision-making erodes trust — and risks driving these critical players away from future procurements.

Additionally, protests often stem from *poorly executed explanations*, not dissatisfaction with the outcome itself. 

By treating feedback as a **two-way conversation**, agencies can also:

* Gather input on what worked and what didn’t  
* Improve future solicitations  
* Build a stronger, more informed tech vendor ecosystem

Done well, a post-evaluation feedback can:

* Build industry trust
* Defend the integrity of the selection process
* Improve the bidding process in the future for similar solicitations

## Debriefing vs other forms of post-evaluation feedback

### Key Rules for Formal Debriefings (FAR Part 15)

Debriefings Are Required when using FAR Part 15 (Negotiated Procurement):

|  | Pre-Award Debrief | Post-Award Debrief |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| When? | Offeror eliminated before award | After award decision |
| Required Info | Summary of evaluation, reason for exclusion, procedures followed | Strengths/weaknesses of proposal, past performance info, award rationale |
| What’s Prohibited | Other offerors’ scores, rankings, proposals | Point-by-point comparisons, trade secrets, confidential info |

### Debriefing Expectations Outside FAR 15

Other acquisition methods handle debriefs differently:

* **Simplified Acquisitions (FAR Part 13):** Only require a brief explanation if requested. Avoid formal FAR 15 terminology.

* **Federal Supply Schedules (FAR Part 8.4):** Similar to simplified acquisition — brief explanation allowed if requested.

* **Task/Delivery Orders under ID/IQs:** Formal debrief required only if order exceeds $5.5M and debrief is requested.

With respect to communications with unsuccessful offerors, FAR Subpart 13.106-3(d) states: “If a supplier requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the contract award decision shall be provided.” The CO has considerable latitude in the “brief explanation” provided to unsuccessful offerors.

FAR 8.405-2(d) states: “If an unsuccessful offeror requests information on an award that was based on factors other than price alone, a brief explanation of the basis for the award decision shall be provided.” As with simplified acquisitions, explanations can be simply stated. For example, the CO may say that the selected offer provides better value consistent with the evaluation factors outlined in the Government’s Request for Quotations. While not required to furnish additional information to an unsuccessful offeror, some agencies may elect to do so.

⚠️ *Avoid using “FAR Part 15” language for simplified methods — it may trigger protest grounds.*

Generally, the Contracting Officer schedules and organizes the feedback session once a request is received, in a timely fashion. The COR, Program Manager/Program Lead, and other technical specialists support the CO and may lead the discussion of or address questions related to the technical findings/evaluation, if applicable.

Other technical specialists participate as needed to address the contractor’s specific concerns. For example, if an acquisition involves complex pricing issues, a cost/pricing analyst may be needed. It is also advisable to include Legal Counsel if contentious issues are involved or if the contractor has an attorney participating.

## The Benefits of Effective Post-Evaluation Exchanges

One of the biggest misconceptions in government procurement is that sharing less information with unsuccessful offerors lowers protest risk.

In practice — especially in digital services acquisitions — the opposite is true. While the CO can choose to give brief explanations, it may actually cause more confusion and lead to companies wanting more information, which they can get through the process of a protest. 

Today’s tech firms and digital service providers are highly sophisticated. 

When done well, feedback shows the Government:

* Followed a fair and clear evaluation process  
* Carefully reviewed each proposal  
* Has nothing to hide

## What Companies Are Really Looking For

When companies request feedback, they are trying to understand a few critical things, such as:

1. Did the evaluation team understand our technical solution?  
    (Or did misunderstandings impact our score?)  
2. Did we fully understand and address the solicitation’s requirements?  
    (Or did we miss something we didn’t realize was critical?)  
3. Was the evaluation conducted exactly as written in the solicitation?  
    (Or did the process shift or become subjective?)

**Answering these clearly builds trust — even if the offeror didn’t win.**

You can also ask them:

* What did or didn’t work for them?  
* Why did they bid?  
* Would they bid again?

Making it a two-way conversation can increase both parties' awareness of what can be done to make future acquisition more successful. 

## **What High Quality Post-Evalutation Feedback Should Include:** 

When possible, agencies should provide feedback that connects the what (requirement), the where (proposal page), and the how (evaluation result).

Best practices include:

| Element | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Specific Solicitation Requirement Reference** | Shows the evaluation tied back to the rules everyone agreed to (Section M). |
| **Proposal Page Numbers** | Demonstrates evaluators reviewed the proposal carefully and fairly. |
| **Benefit or Risk Discussion** | Explains whether and how the proposed solution would help the government mission. |
| **Acknowledgment of Offeror Assumptions** | Addresses where offeror assumptions may have hurt their evaluation — helping them improve in future bids. |
| **Clear Attribution of Strengths and Weaknesses** | Helps offerors understand competitive gaps without speculating or comparing proposals improperly. |

Digital solutions are often modular, iterative, and designed for change — meaning evaluation panels must be even more careful to:

* Accurately recognize technical maturity

* Understand modern practices (agile, human-centered design, devops, cloud-native architectures)

* Avoid traditional biases against non-traditional approaches

**A Model for Setting up Feedback using Slides:** 

Preparing for an evaluation conversation is good to do even if you are only giving a verbal explanation. Setting up slides is a valuable tool in preparing for and conducting effective feedback sessions. The slides included should be tailored to the duration and complexity of the debriefing as well as the specific issues that need to be addressed. Here are some ideas for key points to bring up in any format: 

**Ground Rules**

* The most important ground rule to communicate is that the CO leads the process.   
* The Government is prohibited from doing a point-by-point comparison of the offeror’s proposal with the proposals of others, including the selected company.  
* The Government cannot disclose proprietary information or trade secrets or information exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), including confidential business or manufacturing processes, commercial or financial information, or the identities of individuals who have provided past performance information.

**Summary Slides**

The Summary slides should provide meaningful information that facilitates the contractor’s ability to enhance their future competitiveness. For example, one Summary slide or a set of slides might contrast the debriefed contractor’s ratings and cost with that of the successful offeror.

![Evaluation Summary Slide - Example - displaying a comparative evaluation of three offerors (A, B, C) across four factors: Past Performance, Technical, Management, and Cost/Price.](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/4086a8c8656030276efbcb0cd59d281ed877a289/Media/Module%203/Evaluation%20Summary%20Slide.png)

For pre-award debriefings, revealing ratings and cost/price information for other offerors is not permitted. As a result, this information would be blanked out. 

Pre-award post-evaluation discussions include only the agency’s evaluation of significant elements of the offeror’s proposal and rationale for eliminating it from the competitive range. Because the competitive acquisition is still proceeding, a pre-award feedback session does not provide information such as the number of other offerors nor their evaluations or rankings.

As part of the Summary slides, the team might also include their consensus ratings. This slide depicts the team consensus ratings of the offeror being debriefed for the Management Approach evaluation factor. It cites the specific strengths and weaknesses of the offeror’s management approach. 

![A document titled 'Example Caucus Rating Format' for 'Source Selection For OCIO IT Services.' It details an evaluation for 'Offeror: A' on 'Factor: Management Approach (Factor ranking: 3rd most important).' The ratings are 'Outstanding' for Merit and 'Low' for Risk. The document lists bullet points under 'Strengths' describing the offeror's excellent proposed team, outstanding recruiting, existing processes, employee retention, and documented communication processes, each with a page number reference. It also lists 'Weaknesses' focusing on ad-hoc skills refresher/improvement training. Finally, 'Merit and Risk Ratings Support' provides a summary explaining why the offeror warrants the outstanding merit rating with low risk. ](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/4086a8c8656030276efbcb0cd59d281ed877a289/Media/Module%203/Example%20Caucus%20Rating%20Format.png)

**Final Slide(s):**

The final slide(s) should provide a high-level summary. It should indicate that the evaluation is considered complete and closed. The slide might state, for example:

“In summary, the Government’s selection decision was based on a comparative assessment of all offers consistent with the criteria set forth in Section M of the RFP. As the debriefing showed, the selection represents the most advantageous offer to the Government, price and other factors considered. This concludes the debriefing, and it is considered complete and closed.”

## Checklist: Do’s and Don’ts

During the post-evaluation feedback sessions, DO:

* Set expectations up front  
* Start with strengths  
* Provide helpful, clear information  
* Remain courteous and professional  
* Answer questions if permissible  
* Stay flexible with time  
* Invite feedback to improve future solicitations

During the debriefing, DON’T:

* Apologize  
* Argue or negotiate  
* Compare vendors directly

## Conclusion

Debriefings can really help shape the way vendors bid on future procurements, as well as give you the opportunity to explain why they didn’t win or what they could do better next time.
