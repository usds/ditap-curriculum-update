# Module 2 Sprint 2

## Navigating the Stakeholder Landscape 

### Introduction

When it comes to digital services, success isn't just about technology. It's about people—*your stakeholders*. Some are obvious, like program owners or end users. Others might only become visible once you're deep into the work. By then, their feedback can slow things down or force major changes.

That’s why it’s so important to identify the right people early and involve them at the right time. Stakeholders influence decisions, offer key insights, and help you stay aligned with agency goals, policies, and user needs.

This activity will be introduced in class and completed on your own. You will think through who your stakeholders are, what roles they play, and how best to engage them throughout the acquisition process. With a little planning up front, you can avoid last-minute surprises and build stronger support for your approach.

Let’s get started.

Consider the following two situations:

* **Situation 1:** You’re working on a digital services procurement and need to answer the question, “Who is my customer?” That’s easy, you think. It’s the program office or the program owner \- the visionary and champion for the product or service. But wait a minute. Is that always the case? Are they the end users who will use the product or service? For instance, are they the individual entering data into a system, the citizen using your website to learn about energy efficient products, or the government team that will primarily use  this new tool? The answer to this question will drive how you approach the acquisition. End users should drive your technical and design decisions – so get them involved in the process\! This sounds simple in theory. However, it’s not so simple in execution, when you have other stakeholders – budget, acquisition policy, Chief Information Officers / Information Technology (CIO/IT), as well as vendors and contractors – who feel strongly about the design and execution of the product or service.
  
* **Situation 2:** You’ve spent months putting together an acquisition plan and getting various stakeholders to review and provide feedback along the way. All of a sudden, a new stakeholder—one you hadn’t thought to include to date—provides feedback that requires you to significantly adjust your approach. Frustrated, you think, “If only I had thought to get them on board and involved earlier on, we could’ve had a better product and saved time and money.” We can probably all relate to a time (or times\!) when this has happened and the resulting frustration we felt.

So how do you plan for involving your customers and engaging all stakeholders at the right time in the right way? That’s where this activity comes in!

### Why Is Stakeholder Engagement So Critical on Digital Services Efforts?

According to Agile theory and the TechFAR, it’s critical to bring together the “right” cross-functional team of high performers in order to take on the frequently evolving, rapid pace of digital projects. In addition, “Big A” acquisition methods advocate for broad inclusion of agency leaders, managers, acquisition policy, and oversight functions in the acquisition lifecycle. 

As a function that, in part, is responsible for reducing the risks of legal, regulatory, financial, and compliance exposure in contracting, acquisition resists the unfamiliar and uncertain. Acquisition strategies you may want to pursue in digital services may attract greater scrutiny merely because they are not common practices in the agency, even though they are legal and adhere to acquisition regulations and agency procurement policy. 

To get your stakeholders comfortable with your approaches, you should anticipate a high level of interaction between agency team members, contractors, and other stakeholders. But how do you identify who you should talk to? And, once you have identified them, how and when do you engage with them?

### So, Is This Really That Different From How You’ve Engaged Stakeholders Before?

In some ways, no. You’ll likely see many of the same roles—program owners, legal, contracting, and policy. But digital services work demands a more intentional and flexible approach to stakeholder engagement.

Why? Because you’re often introducing new methods, tools, or expectations that can feel unfamiliar—or even risky—to others. You’re aiming for faster delivery, more collaboration, and outcomes rooted in user needs. That changes when, how, and with whom you engage.

### Why the Landscape Looks Different

The Stakeholder Landscape Map you’ll explore in this activity offers a big-picture view of the many individuals and groups who may shape your acquisition.

It’s not a checklist—it’s a prompt to think strategically about:

* Who can influence or impact your succes  
* What role(s) they play  
* When and how to bring them in

Just remember: people don’t fit neatly into one category. For example, your Head of Contracting Activity (HCA) might be a key acquisition leader, provide oversight, and serve as an internal influencer—all at once.

### Why Tailored Engagement Matters

You won’t engage a compliance officer the same way you would a product owner or a community outreach lead. Each stakeholder has different priorities, power, and concerns.

That’s why thoughtful engagement—early and tailored to their role—is key. It builds trust, reduces friction, and helps your team avoid unnecessary roadblocks later on.

### Zooming Out: Who’s in the Landscape?

Here’s a quick look at the six main stakeholder groups you might encounter in a digital services acquisition:

* **Digital Services Acquisition Partnership:** Your core team—program, product, and procurement partners making it all work.  
* **Served Communities and Customers:** End users, citizens, and front-line staff. Their needs shape the solution.  
* **Acquisition Stakeholders:** Contracting officers, legal, policy advisors—those who help execute and manage the procurement.  
* **Partners, Suppliers, and Co-Creators:** Vendors and external collaborators who contribute ideas and expertise.  
* **Oversight and Governance:** Legal, Office of General Counsel (OGC), Inspector General (IG), and other bodies ensuring compliance and regulatory alignment.  
* **Advocates and Influencers:** Senior champions who can open doors, build buy-in, and smooth the path forward.

### Reflection Prompt (Optional)

Think about a recent or upcoming digital services acquisition you’re working on.

* Who are three stakeholders you haven’t traditionally engaged early, but probably should?  
* What would be the benefit of involving them sooner?

## Activity: Stakeholder Selection & Interview Assignment 

### Introduction

In this two-part activity, you’ll identify the individuals within your agency who are major influencers or gatekeepers in digital services acquisition and develop your strategy for engaging with them. You’ll use your experiences with this program as a springboard for the conversation.

**Activity Goal:** 

By completing this activity, you will: 

1. Gain a better understanding of your agency's readiness for change and innovation,  
2. Practice influence conversations, and  
3. Build your digital services network.

#### **Instructions – Part 1: Prepare**

For Part 1 of this activity, you’ll identify 2-4 people within your agency that you don’t usually have a chance to interact with but who you see as a significant influencer or gatekeeper (e.g., CIO, HCA, CAO, SPE, CFO, Policy Office leader). You may want to create a map (in Visio, PowerPoint, or another mind mapping software) like the sample Stakeholder Landscape graphic, but refine it to mirror the specific stakeholders you need to engage.  This will help you see the potential pool of stakeholders and aid you in narrowing your selection.


| Instructions | Considerations |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **1. Narrow down your list to 2–4 key stakeholders based on the following assumptions:**  | - The most significant perceived level of influence or control over the progress of digital services procurements (stakeholders differ in their level of influence and control)<br><br>- Their perceived level of influence or control over the progress of acquisition, generally in the agency<br><br>- Their potential involvement in your role as a future agency ambassador for digital services acquisition  |
| **2. Conduct basic research on the person and develop hypotheses you would like to test during the conversation. Consider this conversation as a starting point to test your assumptions about their influence in the digital services acquisition process and their role in leading change and innovation in your agency.** | - Position<br>- Years in position<br>- Relationship to you<br>- Span of responsibilities<br>- Work history<br>- Personality<br>- Strengths/Weaknesses<br>- Formal/Informal roles in the acquisition lifecycle<br>- Formal/Informal connections and relationships with other primary stakeholders |
| **3. Hypothesize potential benefits and challenges to their engagement in digital services acquisition.** | Example hypotheses you can develop about your stakeholders<br><br> - Their role can positively affect the acquisition of digital services in the future. Explore the interconnections between their goals and creating agile acquisition methods that are faster, improve quality, and improve outcomes.<br><br>- What is their influence over the acquisition process, and in what parts of it do they play approval, advisory, or recommendation roles?<br><br>- Leaders and stakeholders are called on to lead change and innovation in their agencies. What change or innovation efforts have they been involved in? What lessons can we learn from those initiatives that will benefit digital services acquisition?<br><br>- Change raises issues and concerns in agencies regarding risk, ability to meet mission, cost and financial impacts, employee satisfaction, culture, and other factors. Agile digital services acquisition is a change for the agency in identifying needs, conducting the acquisition process, working with contractors, and iteratively achieving outcomes. What concerns do they have regarding the needed changes to embrace digital services acquisition? |
| **4. While the main goal of this conversation may be to learn about the influencer or gatekeeper, this individual will also be forming their own impression of you. Think about how you would like to position yourself and what influence you will have on this person.** | - Anticipate possible questions the person may have about your background and experience. Depending on the stakeholder, you may have greater expertise in agile and acquisition innovation than your stakeholder does.<br><br>- Take time to review the online learning module on influence to learn about different approaches to the conversation.<br><br>- Identify whether the influencer or gatekeeper may become a future advocate or champion for agile and digital services acquisition. |
| **5. After brainstorming, use the second page of the Stakeholder Holder Interests template to develop your conversation structure. Completing this information will help you feel more prepared for the conversation.** | - Use the [Stakeholder Interests Template](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/cc1c72f6d5dc7b369a5c862b7eaba8236eb183f2/Media/Module%202/Stakeholder%20Interest%20Template.docx) to identify opportunities and challenges in working with stakeholders and to establish a framework for your interview with a stakeholder.<br><br>- Use the [Stakeholder Interview Guide Template](https://github.com/kristenjernigan/kj-liatest/blob/cc1c72f6d5dc7b369a5c862b7eaba8236eb183f2/Media/Module%202/Stakeholder%20Interview%20Guide.docx) to identify questions to ask your stakeholders. |


**For your interview, keep in mind the following:**

* **Purpose:** Why are you having this conversation? What are you trying to achieve?  
* **Structure:** How will I open the conversation? What strategies will I use during the conversation? What does success and the next steps look like?  
* **Resources:** What information must you gather to prepare for the conversation?

Practice your conversation with a cohort member and enlist their feedback. Use their feedback to polish your engagement strategy. This is optional.

**Definition of Done & Deadline for Completion:** Part 1 must be completed in Module 2\. By the end of Module 2, you will need to provide a document for approval that includes: 

* The four stakeholders you intend to interview  
* Your list of questions you plan to ask for feedback (Optional).
 
---

#### **Instructions \- Part 2: Engage**

These interviews will test your hypotheses about the sphere of influence for your stakeholder selections and give you experience conducting influencing conversations.

Document your interviews and reflect on the conversation and your strategy for future engagement using the following questions:

* How accurate was your hypothesis on the amount of influence and control this person has on the acquisition process?   
* How accurate was your hypothesis on their role in leading change and innovation at your agency?  
* How influenced were they by your insights or ideas? How was this evidenced? Were they motivated or energized by your conversation?  
* Would you change anything that would have made the conversation more productive? Were you able to have them "put down" any previous baggage they might have associated with the acquisition process?  
* How does this conversation impact your future conversations with this stakeholder?  
* What is your plan for further engagement with this stakeholder?

Please include the date of your interview and an overview of what you discussed. You should also share your insights from the interview with your classmates.   

#### **Definition of Done** 

To consider this activity completed, you’ll need to adequately prepare for and complete interviews with 2-4 influencer/gatekeepers at your agency and share insights through a written assignment submitted to the Team.
