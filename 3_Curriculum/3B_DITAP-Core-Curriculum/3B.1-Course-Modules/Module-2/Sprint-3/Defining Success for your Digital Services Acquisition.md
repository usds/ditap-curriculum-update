# Module 2 Sprint 3

## Defining Success for Your Digital Services Acquisition

### Overview

Effective digital services acquisition begins long before the first contract document is drafted. It starts with understanding the problem, aligning stakeholders, and translating discovery insights into a strategy that delivers real mission outcomes. This module—**“From** **Discovery to Strategy”**—equips acquisition professionals to make that critical shift.

By leveraging early research, user interviews, and process mapping, contracting and program teams can co-create acquisition strategies that are flexible, user-centered, and outcome-driven. Rather than repeating legacy approaches or writing rigid contracts to avoid risk, this module encourages a mindset of adaptability, collaboration, and alignment—core principles of modern digital service delivery.

Success in digital services doesn’t start with a delivery milestone—it starts with shared clarity. What problem are we solving? For whom? How will we know we’ve done it well? This section walks through how to define success that helps teams stay aligned, responsive to change, and focused on outcomes, not just outputs.

This module emphasizes the strategic role of the acquisition professional in shaping not just the contract, but the success of the entire digital service. By applying these concepts, learners will gain the tools and language to build acquisitions that are not only compliant but truly impactful.

#### Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Define a user-centered problem statement that avoids pre-defined solutions but aligns with user pain points.  
* Draft a product vision statement using structured facilitation questions to describe the desired future state.  
* Facilitate a product visioning session that engages stakeholders in clarifying goals and success outcomes.

* Link product vision to procurement objectives and measurable success metrics using the RoM framework.  
* Differentiate between features and outcomes when writing acquisition objectives and evaluation criteria.  
* Recognize common pitfalls in early acquisition planning (e.g., vague goals, prescriptive requirements).  
* Conduct a constraint discovery session to identify operational, technical, or policy-based acquisition limits.  
* Apply identified constraints to shape acquisition strategies, contract types, timelines, and evaluation methods.  
* Use discovery data and documented tradeoffs to defend and adapt acquisition decisions throughout the lifecycle.

## From Discovery to Strategy

Before defining success or mapping out your constraints, take a moment to reflect on the body of discovery work already completed. When we apply the concept of discovery to the acquisition process, the goal is to create a flexible and mission-aligned plan for buying services or supplies that solve real problems and achieve a positive acquisition outcome. A good digital services acquisition strategy draws from:

* Agency goals and organizational maturity  
* User needs and desired outcomes  
* Market insights and vendor capabilities  
* Risk realities and operational constraints

It should also reflect a complete picture of how you’ll achieve your objectives even when things change. That means:

* Defining a preferred path forward and alternatives  
* Outlining your pivot/persevere conditions  
* Identifying your must-haves and nice-to-haves

### Framing the contract for discovery: 

A contract is simply this: one party has a need, and another agrees to meet that need in exchange for payment, based on mutually accepted terms. Everything else—the complexity, the structure, the competition requirements—builds on top of that foundational exchange.

In digital services acquisition, it’s essential to approach the strategy phase with a fresh mindset. Don’t begin by trying to patch over the failures of past contracts, or by designing a document so rigid that it attempts to eliminate all future risk. Instead, build an adaptable strategy—and a contract—to support an evolving product and accommodate the unknowns that inevitably surface during delivery.

Modern digital acquisition emphasizes the connection between product vision and product delivery. Whether you’re crafting a performance-based or outcome-based procurement, the principle is the same:

* Start with the problem.

* Set a clear vision or objective.

* Let industry propose how to achieve it.

Your discovery work, what stakeholders need, and what users expect should inform the specifics, such as scope, timeline, and level of detail. This creates a shared understanding of the outcomes without prescribing how every detail will be delivered.

By framing your product vision as a **Statement of Objectives (SOO)**, you naturally align digital services delivery with acquisition terminology. This bridges the language of users, technologists, and the structure procurement professionals require.

### From problem to vision

Defining success starts with clearly stating the problem you aim to solve. Use your discovery insights to:

* **Draft a product vision statement** (e.g., "Our solution enables caseworkers to process applications 50% faster without increasing error rates.")  
* **Tie back** to user needs and unmet pain points.  
* **Achievable** – Is it realistic?  
* **Relevant** – Does it solve the right problem?  
* **Time-bound** – When will success be evaluated?

### Facilitation of this process

While going through this process, asking these questions might seem out of place or out of your traditional role. Still, through the repeated efforts of many acquisition professionals working through these types of acquisitions, it has been proven that a contracting officer who takes the baton as the conductor of their process will have a deeper understanding of all the moving pieces, elements, and situations that are bound to come up throughout the procurement. 

We recommend conducting an “Acq-A-thon” to bring all of this together in a one—to two-day workshop. “Acq-A-thons” were coined by the US Digital Service Procurement team in the early days of conducting acquisition strategy sessions with agencies, and variations of these are done by consultants, advisors, and internal procurement teams. Here is an Acq-A-thon Tool Kit that you can use to set up your own. 

**What is an Acq-A-thon?**

An *Acq-A-thon* is a collaborative workshop-style event designed to gather key stakeholders across the acquisition lifecycle to conduct discovery sessions that lead to more innovative, better-informed acquisition strategies. Inspired by the concept of a *hackathon*—an event in which a group of people come together to solve problems collaboratively, often through intense focus and teamwork (typically in coding or software design)—an Acq-A-thon emphasizes acquisition planning.

## Define the problem, vision statement, & objectives

### What is the problem? 

How many times have you, as an acquisition professional, received acquisition requirements from your program office that already define the *solution*, and you have no idea what problem they’re trying to solve?

They’ve done early planning or interviews that the procurement team has not seen, and in doing so, they unknowingly box the acquisition strategy into a corner. You might not realize it until market research turns up misaligned results, the evaluation criteria do not make sense for the product the team needs, or vendors build the wrong thing because the team was solving the wrong problem from the start.

This disconnect frustrates everyone and takes time away from finding a real solution. Here is the DITAP shift: By inserting yourself early, before requirements are locked, you can help the team focus on the problem, which in turn helps create a more flexible, mission-aligned acquisition. This may not have been the traditional role for contracting professionals in the past, but in digital service acquisitions, your strategic involvement from the beginning is encouraged and essential.

**Why this matters:**

* It helps avoid prescriptive requirements or pre-selected solutions.  
  It promotes alignment across leadership, end users, and contracting staff.  
* It sets the stage for outcome-based acquisition.

### Facilitate a problem & product visioning session

One of the most effective ways to uncover the problem and define meaningful objectives is to facilitate a structured stakeholder session. This session brings together program staff, CORs, end users (if possible), and other key voices to explore the underlying challenges and desired outcomes collaboratively.

Prompt for the Contracting Officer:

“Let’s take an hour to align around the problem we’re solving and what success looks like. I’ll guide us through a short working session where we clarify the user pain points, what’s not working today, and what a good future state could look like. From there, we’ll co-create a product vision and draft 1–2 outcome-based objectives to guide our acquisition strategy.”

 **What is a user-centered problem statement?**

* Start with insights from user research and discovery interviews.  
* Identify who is experiencing the problem and what the impact is.  
* Use language that describes behaviors, obstacles, or gaps, not system requirements.

**Example (bad):**

“We need to procure a case management system.”

**Example (better):**

“Field staff currently rely on a legacy system that crashes frequently, making it difficult to complete intake within required timeframes and leading to missed client services.”

**Ask your Program:** “If we don’t solve this problem, what would happen? Who would be affected?”

### Creating a product vision statement

Now that we’ve agreed on the problem, our next step is to describe the future state we want to create and what it looks like if this procurement is successful. This is called the product vision, and it will help us focus on outcomes instead of jumping to specific features or systems. 

### Start by asking these types of questions:

**Product vision facilitation guide – Vision Questions**

| Question | What’s the ask | What to listen for |  How to capture it |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1\. If this works well, what’s different for the user?** | What does success look like from the user’s perspective? What changes in their experience? | Concrete improvements in time, access, simplicity, and frustration levels | Write as: “Users can now \[do X\] without \[pain point\].” |
| **2\. What do we want this tool or service to enable?** | What behavior, action, or outcome should this product make possible that isn’t possible now? | Outcomes, not just features (e.g., “apply easily” not “have a login form”) | Use active verbs: “Enables users to \[action\].” |
| **3\. How does this help the agency deliver its mission?** | What’s the mission-level impact this product supports? How will this make the agency better at what it’s meant to do? | Connection to public service goals—speed, equity, access, cost savings | Frame as: “Supports mission by \[how it contributes to the goal\].” |
| **4\. What’s a sign this product is working as intended?** | What observable signs, metrics, or behaviors would indicate success? | Measurable indicators like reduced drop-off, increased uptake, fewer calls for help | Capture as performance indicators or success criteria |
| **5\. Who benefits the most from this product being successful?** | Which users or communities are most impacted if this product works well? | Equitable service outcomes (e.g., rural families, limited-English speakers) | Use this to inform accessibility, language support, or design considerations |
| **6\. What’s broken today that this is meant to fix?** | Where is the current process's friction, duplication, confusion, or burden? | Problems tied to inefficiency, manual work, miscommunication, and error rates | Use these insights to reinforce the “why” behind the vision |

## Reframing metrics: From Return on Investment (ROI) to Return on Mission (RoM)

**Why it matters:**

In the private sector, success is often measured in Return on Investment (ROI)—did they make more money than they spent?

However, in government, mission outcomes are the return. Whether delivering benefits faster, increasing public trust, or improving equitable access to services, the actual value of a digital service is measured by how well it advances the agency's mission.

**Instead of asking:**

“Did we stay within budget?”

**We must also ask:**  
 	“Did this procurement help us serve the public better?”

Rather than seeing metrics as contract performance tracking or compliance checkpoints, acquisition teams should use them to evaluate the product or service's impact on the mission.

**Example:**

**Product vision:** “Enable families to easily apply for childcare assistance online, without requiring in-person visits or paperwork.”

**Procurement objective:** “Deliver an accessible, mobile-first benefits application experience within 6 months of award.”

**Return on Mission:** “The public value created when more eligible families can successfully access childcare assistance faster, with fewer barriers, leading to improved family economic stability and child wellbeing.” 

### How to recognize Return on Mission in this case

| RoM outcome | Why it matters |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Increased access to childcare assistance** | More families, predominantly low-income and rural, can get the help they need without taking off work or visiting an office. |
| **Improved equity in service delivery** | Removing in-person and paperwork barriers disproportionately helps those who struggle with digital literacy, mobility, or language access. |
| **Reduced time-to-benefits** | When application time drops from 45 minutes to 15 and processing is faster, children get care and parents return to work sooner. |
| **Greater program uptake** | Easier access leads to more eligible families enrolling, which supports the program’s mission. |
| **Cost savings to the government and applicants** | Less staff burden, fewer application errors, and reduced in-office foot traffic. |

**Activity:** The “Using AI to Draft Your Return on Mission and Performance Metrics” activity will be facilitated during class as a guided exercise.

## Linking Product Vision → Procurement Objective → Metrics → Return on Mission

| Phase | Purpose | Key output |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Product vision** | Articulate what long-term public value looks like | Inspiring, user-centered vision statement |
| **Procurement objective** | Translate the vision into clear acquisition goals | Specific outcomes expected from vendor work |
| **Metrics** | Measure progress toward those objectives | Quantitative indicators of success |
| **Return on Mission** | Evaluate how delivery supported the agency's mission | Public impact, service improvement, equity outcomes |

**Instead of asking:**

“How do we ensure vendors meet contract requirements?”

**Ask:**

“How do we measure whether this work helps us fulfill our mission more effectively?”

**This allows teams to:**

* Design performance work statements around impact, not just features.

* Create feedback loops that prioritize iteration and improvement.

* Select vendors who understand mission delivery, not just software development.

 **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

* Writing problem statements that sound like pre-selected solutions.

* Skipping objectives because “we’ll know it when we see it.”

* Setting vague goals like “improve user experience” without measurable criteria.

* Confusing features with outcomes (e.g., “have a dashboard” vs. “help staff track performance in real time”).

## Defining Constraints Before Acquisition Strategy Begins

Before you begin building the acquisition strategy, it's essential to identify constraints that could shape or limit what’s possible in the procurement. 

These are often:

* Technical  
* Legal  
* Operational  
* Policy-based conditions that will affect timelines, solution types, vendor eligibility, or even contract structure. 

You want to treat constraints like design inputs, not limitations.  By identifying and understanding them early, you build a stronger acquisition strategy.

### Why this matters

In practice, not having answers to these questions early on can impact everything, from how you conduct market research to how you structure the solicitation. 

Unfortunately, these issues often surface mid-process, at critical moments when they can delay or even derail the procurement. 

By identifying constraints during the discovery phase, you can prepare to make faster, better-informed decisions and provide future reviewers with a clear rationale for your strategy choices. While gathering this information may initially feel like it slows things down, it’s actually a proactive step that fosters alignment with the program, policy, and security teams and helps avoid bigger delays later.

**Implementation Tip:** It’s easy to treat these questions like a simple checklist, especially for smaller, low-risk procurements. But don’t skip the conversation. Talking through them as a team (instead of just swapping documents) builds trust, gets everyone on the same page, and sets the tone for a more collaborative process. Bonus: It can be fun. When the final solution comes together, and you can trace it back to the thinking you shaped early on, the magic happens. It’s a tangible reminder of how much your expertise matters.

## Suggested questions for constraint discovery sessions


| Topic                      | Questions to Ask |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| Budget & funding          | What is our total available budget? What fiscal year does it apply to? What is the color of money (e.g., O&M, R&D, capital)? Are there timing or obligation restrictions we need to account for? |
| Security & risk           | What are the cybersecurity requirements for this effort? Does it require an Authority to Operate (ATO)? How long do ATOs typically take? What are the known feasibility or system risks? Is there an analysis of alternatives available? |
| Internal vs. contracted expertise | Who from our agency will be directly involved in product development? Are they experienced in agile delivery or digital product management? If internal expertise is limited, do we need coaching, technical assistance, or product support services built into the contract? |
| Onboarding & infrastructure | How long does it typically take to onboard contractors? Are there known firewall, VPN, or credentialing issues that impact when work can begin? Is remote access supported or restricted? |
| Business Process Reengineering (BPR) | Is this effort meant to replicate existing processes in a digital tool (lift-and-shift), or are we rethinking the process? What level of BPR is acceptable to leadership and stakeholders? Is the business process flexible or locked in by law/policy? |
| Contractual constraints   | Are there mandatory set-aside rules or preferred vehicles (e.g., GSA, GWACs)? Are certifications required (e.g., 508, FedRAMP, Section 889)? Can we phase work modularly, or must it be awarded as a single solution? |
| Team capacity & roles     | Is there a designated Product Owner or COR who will oversee day-to-day work? Do they have enough time and authority to manage this? Will the contractor be expected to lead outcomes, or follow detailed government direction? |
| Technology environment    | Will the solution integrate with legacy systems or require cloud migration? Are there existing development platforms or data environments it must align with? |


## Why defining constraints early pays off

Once constraints are identified and documented during the discovery phase, they stop being unknown risks and become powerful decision-making tools. They give you the full context needed to shape a realistic, achievable procurement aligned with your agency’s mission, not just a paper strategy that collapses under real-world pressure.

Early constraint discovery enables your team to be proactive, not reactive, and avoids costly backtracking later in the process. Here’s how it plays out:

**You can shape the acquisition strategy around real-world boundaries.**

Knowing your constraints early lets you tailor the strategy to what’s possible technically, legally, operationally, and financially. Instead of planning around an ideal solution that fits no one’s actual environment, you’re developing a plan that reflects how your agency works, including infrastructure, policies, and capacity.

Example: If contractor onboarding takes 90 days and your COR is already at capacity, you can plan for a delayed PoP start, include coaching or embedded delivery support in the scope, or explore a staged award with onboarding prerequisites built in.

This includes boundaries like:

* Whether work can be done remotely or must be on-site  
* Whether FedRAMP or ATO timelines affect launch planning  
* How much of the current process can be reengineered, and how much must stay intact

**You can choose the right contract type, structure, and performance period.**

The constraints you uncover—such as funding ceilings, color of money, security access, or internal staffing—will inform the contracting model, contract type, and performance structure you use (SOO vs. PWS). You’ll avoid the common mistake of choosing a contract form before understanding what the work truly demands.

Examples:

* If you have only partial-year funding or uncertain appropriations, consider using a modular BPA, IDIQ, or task order approach.  
* If cybersecurity rules prevent system access for 60–90 days, build in a phased contract structure with a “discovery phase”, user research, or pre-access onboarding that allows meaningful work to start but does not affect security regulations.  
* If internal staff will lead product development, the contract may focus on coaching, training, or advisory services rather than full delivery.

**You’ll prevent mid-process surprises that slow down awards or lead to bad outcomes.**

Without early constraint discovery, you risk hitting critical issues during acquisition planning or evaluation, when it’s too late to adjust without delay or rework. By anticipating challenges up front, you avoid surprise showstoppers like:

* An ATO process or backlog that might block delivery  
* An IT infrastructure that doesn’t support the planned solution  
* Inflexible “lift-and-shift” expectations when true reengineering is required  
  Staff who are too over-extended to manage a high-touch vendor

**Risks you can avoid:**

* Rushed or unnecessary contract modifications  
* Redoing market research because the initial scope was unrealistic  
* Legal reviews that delay the award due to missed compliance flags  
* Confused vendors submitting non-responsive proposals  
* Award protests due to unclear or conflicting evaluation criteria

## Using data to defend your decisions

Defining constraints early helps you build a **mission-aligned, defensible acquisition strategy** that drives **real results**, not just contract execution.

When stakeholders and reviewers see that you’ve accounted for **practical limits** and **internal realities**, it builds **confidence** in your approach.

In digital service procurements, this matters even more

Understanding the landscape of constraints during the discovery phase isn’t just about designing a better acquisition—it’s about building:

* **Trust** across teams and stakeholders  
* **Clarity** in decision-making  
* **Resilience** throughout the entire contract lifecycle

**Why it pays off**

A well-informed team that communicates openly and documents early decisions will be better prepared when challenges inevitably arise, whether during the solicitation phase or contract administration.

### Benefits of Early Constraint Discovery

* Creates a shared understanding of why trade-offs were made  
* Strengthens cross-team relationships  
* Enables faster, more confident problem-solving  
* Equips the team to adapt if the work shifts or performance issues arise  
* Supports realistic exit strategies before you're in crisis

## Bottom Line

Constraint discovery is not just a planning step; it’s a practice of risk management and collaborative alignment that supports more confident, mission-focused decision-making from start to finish.
