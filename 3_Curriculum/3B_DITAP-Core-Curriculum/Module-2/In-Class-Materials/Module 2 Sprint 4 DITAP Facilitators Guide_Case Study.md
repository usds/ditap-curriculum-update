## I. Overview & objectives

In this session, learners apply market research planning techniques to Casey’s CRM project from the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case study. Building on their stakeholder analysis, they identify knowledge gaps and begin shaping a high-level plan to better understand user needs, constraints, and potential vendors.

**Learning Objectives**:
* Draft research questions based on known needs and uncertainties  
* Identify market research methods relevant to digital service acquisitions  
* Understand how stakeholder insights shape early research priorities  
* Connect research activities to downstream procurement decisions

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to deepen application of the Nagivating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges case. It is *not part of the original case study* but builds on Milestone 1 to help learners connect stakeholder insights to early market research planning and discovery strategy. |

## III. Session agenda & activities

**Sprint 4 Activity: Market Research Planning**  
**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**Instructions:**  
- Ask learners to imagine they’re supporting Casey’s team as they prepare for early market research. In small groups, they should:  
    - Identify 2–3 key open questions or uncertainties
    - List information sources (e.g., user interviews, IT inventories, RFIs)
    - Choose methods to fill gaps (e.g., industry scan, stakeholder interviews)  
- Encourage teams to tie each research idea back to a specific stakeholder concern or organizational constraint.  
- Reinforce the link between what they learn now and decisions they’ll make in Module 3.

**Expected Outcomes:**
* A rough outline of a research plan addressing known gaps  
* Clarity on how discovery work will inform next steps in design

**Optional Extension Activities:**
* **Define Success:** Ask teams to write a success statement for the CRM project based on current insights.  
* **Readiness Check:** Facilitate a brief discussion: *“Is this agency ready for cloud CRM?”* Use stakeholder data to explore readiness.

**Next Steps/Follow-Up:**
* [See FAR 10 Integration Assignment](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-2/In-Class-Materials/Module%202%20FAR%2010%20Integration%20DITAP%20Facilitators%20Guide_Case%20Study.md)
