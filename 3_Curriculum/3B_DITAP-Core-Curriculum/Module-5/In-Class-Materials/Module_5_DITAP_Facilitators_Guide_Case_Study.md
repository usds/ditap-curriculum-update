### I. Overview & Objectives

In this session, learners will explore how to apply adaptive leadership and influence strategies to navigate resistance, lead cross-functional teams, and sustain change in digital acquisition environments. It reinforces a critical skill set woven throughout the DITAP course: how to make change happen in complex systems. By connecting back to earlier activities—like stakeholder mapping (Module 2) and delivery planning (Module 4)—Module 5 helps learners reflect on the leadership mindset and influence strategies that underpin every successful digital acquisition.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Apply adaptive leadership and influence techniques in response to setbacks and pushback
- Reflect on personal change leadership approaches and identify opportunities for growth
- Strengthen resilience and emotional intelligence when advancing innovation
- Connect mindset, wellness, and strategy as tools for sustaining long-term change efforts

### III. Session Agenda & Activities

#### Activity: Leading Change and Navigating Resistance

Time: 45–60 minutes <br>
Purpose: To help learners recognize leadership traits and apply adaptive strategies for navigating resistance and advancing innovation

**Instructions:**

1. **Opening Prompts:**
    - “Would you call yourself a leader at work? Why or why not?”
    - “What makes a leader, really?”
    - "What leadership skills did Casey demonstrate in resolving stakeholder conflict?"
2. **Peer Reflection Share:**
    - "How might you apply a similar approach in your own role? Where have you led change without formal authority?"
3. **Call Back Moment:**
    - Ask learners to revisit their stakeholder maps from Module 2.
    - "What new insights do you have about the resistance Casey may face compared to what you identified earlier in the course?"
    - “How does the stakeholder resistance Casey is facing relate to the stakeholder mapping you completed in module 2?”
4. **Core Activities:**
    - **Building Alignment and Momentum:** Present a short summary of Casey’s IPT conflict (role confusion, competing priorities, and delivery pressure). Ask groups to propose strategies Casey could use to align the team and regain momentum.
    - **Casey’s Professional Development:** In small groups, draft a short coaching plan—what would you advise Casey to do to grow their influence and emotional intelligence?
    - **Point Out What’s Missing:** Invite learners to consider: "What if Casey faced resistance from end-users, not just stakeholders? How would that shift the leadership approach?"
5. **Optional Creative Facilitation Strategies (choose 1–2):**
    - **Leadership Hot Seat:** Ask for one volunteer per group to sit in a “hot seat” and role-play Casey. The rest of the group becomes Casey’s peer coaches. They ask clarifying questions, offer advice, and challenge assumptions.
    - **Resistance Gallery Walk:** Create three or four posters or digital boards titled with common forms of resistance (e.g., "Loss of Control," "Fear of the Unknown," "Competing Priorities"). Groups rotate around the room, jotting down where they’ve seen these types of resistance in real life—and what strategies helped.
    - **Stakeholder Map Rewind/Fast Forward:** Have learners pull up or redraw their stakeholder maps from Module 2. Ask them to annotate what has changed since then _because of Casey’s leadership_ (Rewind) and what could change if she _did more/did something differently_ (Fast Forward).
    - **"Dear Future Me" Reflection:** End the session with a quiet reflective exercise. Ask learners to write a short note to themselves about one leadership behavior they want to build on or try—something they learned from Casey’s journey. Go to [futureme.org](http://futureme.org) and schedule-send them for a year from now.
    - **Leadership Tarot:** Create a deck of cards (physical or virtual) with prompts inspired by the course (e.g., “You’ve been assigned to a team of skeptics,” “You’ve hit a wall with a key stakeholder,” “You’re asked to step up without formal authority”). Each group draws a card and must respond with how they’d apply adaptive leadership techniques.
6. **Reflection:**
    - "Rate your confidence from 0–5 in leading change in your organization."
        - Start with lower scores: What’s holding you back?
        - Then call on higher scores: What helps build your confidence?
    - “What parallels do you see between Casey’s development and your own professional and personal growth journey?”

### Expected Outcomes:

- Clear articulation of stakeholder resistance strategies
- Deeper understanding of leading without formal authority

### Facilitation Notes & Best Practices Facilitator Tips:

- Normalize that leadership without authority is the norm in digital transformation
- Encourage vulnerability and realism—change is messy
- Link back to roles explored in Agile delivery in Module 4
- Emphasize that this is a culmination point—learners should draw from the whole course to inform how they lead
- Emphasize that federal digital transformation often involves navigating partnership dynamics between government, contractors, and teams of contractors and their respective firms.
- Help learners connect resistance patterns to common federal scenarios (budget cycles, political transitions, compliance concerns)
- Guide discussion toward practical influence tactics within federal hierarchies

### IV. Next Steps/Follow-Up:

- Prepare for final reflections and recommendations in Module 6 (Milestones 4 and 5)
