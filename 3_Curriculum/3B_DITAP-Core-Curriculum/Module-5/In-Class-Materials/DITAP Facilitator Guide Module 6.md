## Overview & Objectives

    

### Module Summary 

Successful change efforts depend upon relationships and collaboration. In this module, you will learn to apply techniques to create the culture of innovation within your sphere that enables you and others to effectively lead customers to the best solutions. 

In Sprint 1, you will gain skills in preparing for and holding “influence” conversations and learn about preparing for and processing difficult conversations. The sprint includes examples of common topics for difficult conversations, such as acquisition, knowledge of Agile, organizational culture, organizational oversight, and more.  

Sprint 2 moves into leadership of organization change and developing a culture of continuous improvement and scalable practices. You will find a step-by-step model for leading organizational change and assess your own change style.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, participants will be able to:

* Identify their spheres of influence.  
* Identify typical challenges they may encounter when working with various stakeholders in those spheres.  
* Plan for influence conversations based on challenges and opportunities in their agency or current digital assignment.  
* Assess their strengths and change style.  
* Develop a personal plan for contributing to and promoting change within their agency and the broader government community.

### Connection to Overall DITAP Program 

This module supports the DITAP competency area(s) of advancing change as an individual and within an organization, encouraging a culture of innovation and learning by applying methods for continuous improvement and scalable practices. It aligns with the broader goals of the DITAP program by reinforcing the shift from traditional, process-heavy procurement toward a more adaptive, outcome-driven approach that supports digital service delivery.

This session builds on prior learning from Module 4, as learners prepare for digital acquisition procurement in the real world. It helps bridge the gap between theory and application by introducing tools such as generative AI, applying an agile-style retrospective post-procurement and the Kotter Model for change that help inspire and provide impetus to stay abreast of developments in the field and sharing insights within the agency.

2. ### Discussion: Strategy For Introducing New Ideas

   Total Time Allocation:  30 min

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: To think strategically about adapting and advancing their plan within the context of important relationships and timelines.  
   * **Expected Outcomes**: Learners will be able to think critically and look for specific opportunities to make headway with new ideas.  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):   
     * Whiteboard and markers or digital collaboration tool  
   * **Instructions**:   
     Divide learners into breakouts (20 min)  
     Come together to report out (10 min)  
     **Prompt:** Think of a situation in your agency where your ideal vision clashed with an existing approach. How could you have adapted your strategy to make progress without losing momentum or relationships?   
     * Have the group come up with instances where their vision clashed with the status quo in their agency.   
     * Have people share both their challenge and one idea for a more ‘winnable’ path forward—small steps they could take that respect the status quo while still nudging it forward.

     **Prompt:** Instead of focusing on what didn’t go as planned, focus on what you might have done—or still could do—to make your approach more effective.

      * Could you have adjusted your timing?  
      * Could you have involved a different stakeholder earlier in the process?  
      * Could you have reframed your ask to align better with their priorities?

  **Prompt**: Let’s aim to share both the challenge and one idea for a more ‘winnable’ path forward—small steps you could take that respect the status quo while still nudging it forward.

       4. Who in my network is good at this—can I learn from them?

6. ### Optional Activity: Tiny Habits, Big Impact

   TEDx Video Reflection: **[Tiny Habits for Big Change](https://youtu.be/AdKUJxjn-R8)**  
   Total Time Allocation: 40-50 min

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: To reflect on the concept of incremental changes in relation to digital acquisition at their agency.  
   * **Expected Outcomes**: At the end of this activity, participants will have identified at least one small change they could lead and grow at their agency.  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):   
     * Notetaking materials (digital or physical)  
   * **Instructions**:   
     * **Step 1: Watch the TEDx Talk (17 min)**  
       **Prompt (before watching)**: We invite you to watch a short TEDx talk that explores how major change can happen through small, repeatable habits. As you watch, **think about how this concept applies to digital acquisition in your agency.** What’s one tiny change you could lead that might snowball into something bigger?

     * **Step 2 : Guided Reflection (5 min)**  
       **Reflect on:**  
       1. How do small changes lead to big results?  
       2. What “tiny” changes could you start with?  
       3. How can you build trust through early wins?

       Pause for participants to jot down one small change to try out. 

       Participants put their thoughts in a shared Google doc or similar, or each in their own notes if you’re lacking tech.

       

    * **Step 3: Optional Breakout Discussion (10-15 min)**  
        3-4 people per group  
        1. One small change they’re considering  
        2. What barriers they might face  
        3. How they might build support or momentum

     Encourage them to listen for overlaps or patterns.

    * **Step 4: Share-Back & Close (5-10 min)**  
      One person from each group shares a key takeaway, especially any “tiny changes” that sparked ideas.

    **Wrap up** with this message:

  “Sustainable transformation in government doesn’t always start with a big, top-down initiative. Sometimes, it begins with a small, intentional action—something you can repeat, model, and build momentum around.”

7. ### Reflection Activity: Crafting Your Vision

   Total Time Allocation: 5-10 min

   #### Activity Instructions:

   * **Purpose**: Participants will have a set of mechanisms they can turn to to communicate their vision and enact change in their agency.  
   * **Expected Outcomes**: At the end of this activity, participants will be able to envision team, user, and agency success based on their efforts and influence for change.  
   * **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):   
     * Notetaking materials (digital or physical)   
   * **Instructions**:   
     **Prompt**: Take a moment to jot down your vision. Ask yourself: what change do I want to see? Who will it serve? And what makes this effort worth supporting? Think beyond deliverables—what does success look like for your team, your users, and your agency? A well-crafted vision helps make the case for change and keeps people aligned over time.  
     Reflect on (from slide):  
     * What future state am I trying to create?  
     * Who benefits from this change—and how?  
     * What will success look like in 6 months? 1 year?  
     * How can I connect this to agency values?

8. ### Change Contribution Plan

     
   Total Time Allocation: 10 min

   #### **Activity Instructions:**

   * **Purpose:**  to help learners think about how they will take action with their contributions and make a plan, with their primary change style in mind.  
     **Expected Outcomes:** They will have documented a practical plan to start their change contributions at their agency.  
     **Materials Needed** (specific to activity):  None  
   * **Instructions**:   
     **Prompts**:   
    * *How will I stay informed about tech and trends?*   
       * Let’s start with staying current. You don’t have to know everything about every new technology—but you do need to keep your eyes open to shifts that affect your agency’s work. What’s one manageable habit you can adopt to stay informed? It could be reading one article a month, joining a virtual briefing, or following industry leaders online.  
       **Example:** “I’ll subscribe to the FAI newsletter and follow two gov tech leaders on LinkedIn.”  
    * *What’s one change I’ll lead or support?*  
      * Think about one specific change. This doesn’t have to be large-scale—small, visible efforts matter. Maybe it’s launching a new collaboration space or helping streamline a recurring procurement process. Try to tie this back to your change style for a more natural fit.  
      **Example:**  
      “As a Connector, I’ll start a quarterly knowledge-sharing session.”  
    * *What’s one learning habit I’ll strengthen?*  
      * What’s one habit you can build to reinforce that growth mindset? Carve out a small amount of time each month—or even each quarter—to explore something new. Keep it low-pressure but consistent. These micro-habits add up over time.  
      **Example:**  
      “I’ll set aside 1 hour/month to read a new article or case study.”
