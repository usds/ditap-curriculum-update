**Learning Objectives:**
* Use SWOT analysis to evaluate CRM solution paths  
* Identify key trade-offs and decision points
* Begin shaping an acquisition strategy based on discovery insights

## II. Materials & Preparation

**Materials:**
* Cynuria Case Study Milestone 2  
* SWOT Analysis Template

**Pre-Read for Participants:**
* Read Cynuria Case Study Milestone 2

## III. Session Agenda & Activities

**Activity:** SWOT Analysis of Solution Paths  
**Time:** 60-75 minutes  
**Purpose:** Evaluate CRM options using structured analysis and case data

**Instructions:**
- **Frame the Task (\<5 min)**  
    - Read aloud the Milestone goal from the case:
        - To complete this milestone, systematically evaluate numerous factors to make a decision that ensures alignment with your organization’s strategic goals and operational requirements. For example, you will assess the current state and needs, evaluate custom APIs, create a life cycle cost estimate and also analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of each option provided in the case below. Then make a decision and plan for integrating and monitoring the chosen solution and its performance.
        - That’s a lot to tackle—let’s break it down step by step.  
- **Recap & Warm-Up Discussion (\<5 min)**  
    - Before we jump into evaluating CRM options, let’s bring forward what we’ve learned so far. Ask the group:  
        - Who are the key players in this decision (Casey, Alex, Riley), and what are their top priorities or concerns?  
        - Based on your stakeholder analysis:  
            – What is Casey’s business need and current state?  
            – What are Alex’s integration concerns and technical constraints?  
            – What compliance or risk factors might Riley flag?  
        - Based on your market research plan:  
            – What types of solutions were you expecting to explore?  
            – What key assumptions or questions still need to be addressed?  
- **Small Group Work (15 min)**
    - Each group should:  
        - Begin by reviewing your notes from Sessions 1 and 2\. Add 2–3 key takeaways to your SWOT worksheet that should inform your evaluation of the options.
        - Add to the “current state” summary
        - Complete a SWOT analysis for each option
        - Consider high-level cost implications  
- **Share Outs (15 min)**  
    - Invite groups to share:  
        - Strengths, weaknesses, risks, and alignment with agency goals  
        - Recommendation and rationale  
- **Make a Decision (5 min)**  
    - Teams select one option and justify their choice using discovery insights (stakeholder needs, readiness, constraints, risk appetite).  
- **Plan for Integration (10 min)**  
    - Teams sketch a high-level integration plan:
        - Implementation steps
        - Responsible roles and dependencies
        - Timeline or rollout phases  
- **Plan for Monitoring (10 min)**  
    - Outline how the team will assess performance:  
        - Metrics or KPIs
        - Feedback loops
        - Risk monitoring and governance  
- **(Optional) Use the Madlib Template (10 min)**  
    - Provide teams with this prompt:
        - After evaluating both options, our team recommends implementing **\[Chosen Solution\]** because it offers **\[key advantage\]**.  
        - To integrate this solution, we propose **\[brief integration plan\]**, involving **\[key partners\]** and addressing **\[challenges\]**.  
        - We will monitor performance by tracking **\[indicators\]** and reviewing outcomes every **\[cadence\]**.  
- **Full Group Debrief (10 min)**  
    - What influenced your team’s decision?  
    - Why might Casey’s team pick CRM over COTS? What trade-offs are involved?  
    - What would Casey’s team need to test or validate before finalizing this approach?

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Completed SWOT templates  
* Well-reasoned solution choices  
* Initial integration and monitoring strategies

## IV. Next Steps / Follow-Up

Ensure students are familiar with Milestones 3–5. Encourage them to capture relevant notes along the way.
