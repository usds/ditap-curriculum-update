### I. Overview & Objectives  
In this module, learners will explore what digital services are, how they are delivered, and why they matter. This session sets the foundation for the program by introducing the key concepts, players, and methods in modern federal digital acquisition. 

The case study, [*Navigating Stakeholder and Decision-Making Challenges*](https://github.com/usds/ditap-curriculum-update/blob/main/3_Curriculum/3B_DITAP-Core-Curriculum/Module-1/In-Class-Materials/Case%20Study%3A%20Navigating%20Stakeholder%20and%20Decision-Making%20Challenges.md), created by [Cynuria](https://cynuria.com/), is introduced here as the threaded scenario for the program. By reviewing the full case early, learners gain a “journey map” of the key topics and challenges they will return to in future modules. This session will foreshadow Casey’s upcoming decisions and the cascading challenges they may face.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Identify the major players and sources of digital service delivery.  
* Understand agile, cloud, and human-centered delivery methods.  
* Connect course content to a real-world case study scenario.  
* Analyze how federal acquisition processes can enable or constrain digital service delivery methods.  
* Define digital services and describe their key characteristics.

This is the first of several touchpoints with the Cynuria case, providing participants with a narrative thread that connects technical concepts with real challenges and decisions.

| Note: This is an extension activity designed to orient learners to the Cynuria case. It is *not part of the original case study* but helps surface early hypotheses and connections between course concepts and Casey’s environment. |

### III. Session Agenda & Activities

**Activity:** Laying the Groundwork for Agile Delivery  
**Time:** 45–60 minutes  
**Purpose:** To prepare learners to design a Sprint 0 plan and align key roles and rhythms post-award.

**Instructions:**

- **CRM Delivery Planning Brainstorm (10–15 min)**
    * Prompt: *“Imagine this contract is awarded. What metrics would you want in place to track CRM delivery success?”*  
    * Facilitate a group discussion to surface risks, indicators of delivery health, and early warning signs.
- **Team Sprint 0 Planning (20–30 min)**
    * In small groups, learners design a Sprint 0 plan for the CRM solution selected in Milestone 3\.  
    * Ask: “What assumptions did we make in Milestone 3 that are now causing friction? What would we want to know or clarify before award that we didn’t specify in our requirements or evaluation?”  
    * Plans should include onboarding steps, team roles (CO/COR/PO), key agile ceremonies, collaboration rhythms, and early backlog refinement.  
    * Invite each group to share 1 success metric and 1 delivery risk.
- **Reflection (10–15 min)**
    * Prompt: *“On a scale from 0–5, how confident do you feel in managing post-award delivery? What influenced your score?”*  
      * Invite discussion starting with lower scores to identify perceived barriers, then higher scores to crowdsource ideas.  
    * Follow-up Prompts:   
      * *“How has your perspective on post-award delivery changed since the start of the course?”*  
      * *“If you inherited this contract from your past selves—based on your earlier requirements and decisions—what would frustrate you? What would you wish had been planned differently?”*

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Drafted Sprint 0 plans  
* Shared delivery risks and success metrics  
* Greater confidence in agile delivery planning

**Tips for Facilitators:**

**Pre-Read for Participants:**
* Cynuria Case Study  
* "Exploring Your Role in Leading Change" PDF

### III. Session Agenda & Activities 

**Activity: Leading Change and Navigating Resistance**

**Time**: 45–60 minutes 
**Purpose**: To help learners recognize leadership traits and apply adaptive strategies for navigating resistance and advancing innovation.

**Instructions**:

- **Opening Prompts:**  
   * “Would you call yourself a leader at work? Why or why not?”   
   * “What makes a leader, really?”  
   * "What leadership skills did Casey demonstrate in resolving stakeholder conflict?"  
- **Peer Reflection Share:**  
   * "How might you apply a similar approach in your own role? Where have you led change without formal authority?"  
- **Call Back Moment:**  
   * Ask learners to revisit their stakeholder maps from Module 2\.  
   * "What new insights do you have about the resistance Casey may face compared to what you identified earlier in the course?"  
   * “How does the stakeholder resistance Casey is facing relate to the stakeholder mapping you completed in module 2?”  
 - **Core Activities:**  
   * **Building Alignment and Momentum:** Present a short summary of Casey’s IPT conflict (role confusion, competing priorities, and delivery pressure). Ask groups to propose strategies Casey could use to align the team and regain momentum.  
   * **Casey’s Professional Development:** In small groups, draft a short coaching plan—what would you advise Casey to do to grow their influence and emotional intelligence?  
   * **Point Out What’s Missing:** Invite learners to consider: "What if Casey faced resistance from end-users, not just stakeholders? How would that shift the leadership approach?"  
- **Optional Creative Facilitation Strategies (choose 1–2):**  
   * **Leadership Hot Seat:** Ask for one volunteer per group to sit in a “hot seat” and role-play Casey. The rest of the group becomes Casey’s peer coaches. They ask clarifying questions, offer advice, and challenge assumptions.  
   * **Resistance Gallery Walk:** Create three or four posters or digital boards titled with common forms of resistance (e.g., "Loss of Control," "Fear of the Unknown," "Competing Priorities"). Groups rotate around the room, jotting down where they’ve seen these types of resistance in real life—and what strategies helped.  
   * **Stakeholder Map Rewind/Fast Forward:** Have learners pull up or redraw their stakeholder maps from Module 2\. Ask them to annotate what has changed since then *because of Casey’s leadership* (Rewind) and what could change if she *did more/did something differently* (Fast Forward).  
   * **"Dear Future Me" Reflection:** End the session with a quiet reflective exercise. Ask learners to [write a short note to themselves](futureme.org) about one leadership behavior they want to build on or try—something they learned from Casey’s journey. Schedule-send them for a year from now.  
   * **Leadership Tarot:** Create a deck of cards (physical or virtual) with prompts inspired by the course (e.g., “You’ve been assigned to a team of skeptics,” “You’ve hit a wall with a key stakeholder,” “You’re asked to step up without formal authority”). Each group draws a card and must respond with how they’d apply adaptive leadership techniques.  
- **Reflection:**  
   * "Rate your confidence from 0–5 in leading change in your organization."  
     * Start with lower scores: What’s holding you back?  
     * Then call on higher scores: What helps build your confidence?  
   * “What parallels do you see between Casey’s development and your own professional and personal growth journey?”

**Expected Outcomes:**
* Clear articulation of stakeholder resistance strategies  
* Deeper understanding of leading without formal authority

**Facilitation Notes & Best Practices Facilitator Tips:**
* Normalize that leadership without authority is the norm in digital transformation  
* Encourage vulnerability and realism—change is messy  
* Link back to roles explored in Agile delivery in Module 4  
* Emphasize that this is a culmination point—learners should draw from the whole course to inform how they lead  
* Emphasize that federal digital transformation often involves navigating partnership dynamics between government, contractors, and teams of contractors and their respective firms.  
* Help learners connect resistance patterns to common federal scenarios (budget cycles, political transitions, compliance concerns)  
* Guide discussion toward practical influence tactics within federal hierarchies
