# Activity: Create a Sprint Backlog
_Module 1, Sprint 2_

- **Time**: 45–60 minutes 
- **Audience**: Federal procurement professionals (1102s) learning Agile & HCD 
- **Activity type**: Small-group breakout + share-out 
- **Goal**: Practice writing user stories and building a prioritized Sprint Backlog based on a realistic digital services project.

## Scenario: Improving disaster assistance request portal
The fictional **Federal Emergency Solutions Agency (FESA)** is launching a new digital portal to help citizens request disaster assistance after major storms, floods, or fires.

FESA’s current form-based system is slow, hard to use on mobile, and often results in incomplete applications. The new system must support:
- Mobile-first design
- Identity verification
- Real-time eligibility feedback
- Document upload
- Accessibility for screen readers
- Multilingual support 

FESA wants to release a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** in 2 months. Your cross-functional team has one sprint to get started.

### Materials
- User story template (e.g., “As a [user], I want to [action] so that [goal].”)
- Sprint backlog worksheet
- Markers, sticky notes, or shared digital whiteboard (e.g., Miro, Jamboard, Google Slides)
- Scenario brief (above)

## Instructions (facilitator-led)
⏱️ **0–10 min: Intro & setup**
- Briefly review what a Sprint Backlog is:
    - A prioritized list of tasks or user stories the team commits to completing in a sprint.
- Introduce the scenario and templates.
- Form groups of 3–5 participants. 

⏱️ **10–35 min: Group work**

Each team will:
- Identify 3–5 user roles (e.g., “disaster survivor,” “FESA caseworker,” “accessibility reviewer”).
- Write user stories based on the needs outlined in the scenario.
- Estimate effort (use T-shirt sizing: S, M, L if no experience with story points).
- Prioritize which user stories would make it into the first sprint.
- Fill in the sprint backlog worksheet. 

Encourage teams to consider Agile and HCD principles:
- What is the MVP?
- What can they validate early through feedback?
- Are stories accessible and user-centered? 

⏱️ **35–50 min: Share-out**

Each group presents:
- 2–3 key user stories
- Their priorities and rationale
- Any trade-offs they discussed
- Facilitator captures themes on a shared board. 

⏱️ **50–60 min: Debrief**
- What was challenging about breaking down the work?
- How did thinking in user stories shift your perspective from traditional requirements?
- How could procurement shape a contract to allow this kind of work? 

## Learning objectives
By the end of this activity, learners will be able to:
- Translate project goals into user-centered backlog items
- Understand how to prioritize work for a sprint
- Recognize how procurement can enable iterative delivery and HCD-aligned outcomes

### User story template
Structure: As a **[role]**, I want **[functionality]** so that **[goal]**.
- Role: Who is the functionality for?
- Functionality: What do you want it to do?
- Goal: Why is this functionality needed?

Example: 
_As a **screen reader user**, I want to **navigate the form using a keyboard and screen reader** so that **I can apply independently**._

### Sprint backlog worksheet 
- Priority: High / Medium / Low — based on user impact, dependencies, or MVP goals.
- Estimated Effort: Use T-shirt sizing (S = small, M = medium, L = large) if the team is new to Agile.
- Notes: Any considerations, dependencies, or technical constraints.
