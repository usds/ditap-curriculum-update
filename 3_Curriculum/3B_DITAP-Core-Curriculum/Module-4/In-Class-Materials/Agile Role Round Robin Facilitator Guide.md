# Facilitator Guide: Who Does What? Agile Role Round Robin

**Time:** 45 \- 60 minutes  
**Format:** Small groups (4–6 people each), Role Rotation Activity (instructor-led virtual or in-person)</br>
**Learning Outcome**: To help participants distinguish between federal and vendor responsibilities during Agile delivery by exploring role-based decision-making and identifying alignment points across roles.  

## Activity agenda:  

**Introduction (5 min)**
* Explain the learning goal: understanding who owns what in Agile execution.  
* Emphasize that overlapping responsibilities are normal, but role clarity prevents blockers.

**Scenario rotation activity (30 min)**
* Participants are divided into breakout groups.  
* Each group receives 2–3 realistic Agile delivery prompts.  
* Roles are rotated for each scenario: PO, COR, CO, and Vendor.  
* Each person answers: "What should this role do in this situation?"  
* Quickly discuss the answers to identify and correct any unclear answers. 

**Debrief and discussion (10–20 min)**
* Bring the class back together.  
* Each group shares one scenario and a key insight about role overlap, friction, or coordination.  
* The facilitator leads reflection on creating shared understanding and process clarity.

### Sample scenarios:  
Present these as slides or as a team facilitator in each group \- do as many as practicable for the time allotted for this activity. 

1\. **Missed Sprint Goal:** The team didn’t complete the committed backlog because they were waiting on PO feedback.  
2\. **Scope Shift:** A new feature request comes mid-sprint from a program stakeholder.  
3\. **Performance Issue:** A developer is consistently missing deadlines and disengaging from standups.  
4\. **Demo Failure:** The demo shows incomplete or broken features.  
5\. **COR Unavailable:** The COR is out for two weeks, and no performance observations are being recorded.  
6\. **Questionable Invoice:** The vendor submits an invoice for features that the PO hasn’t formally accepted.

## Materials:
* Scenario Prompts  
* Shared Slides per group  
* **Optional in class:** Role hats/labels for fun

## Facilitator tips:
* Encourage learners to focus on "what their role can control," not what others "should have done."  
* Watch for confusion between the PO (product decisions) and COR (performance tracking).  
* Use the debrief to highlight how contract structure, team agreements, and communication protocols help define boundaries.  
* Consider ending with a shared template or checklist for establishing team roles during kickoff.

### Debrief notes

* What was the most challenging role to take on and why?  
* What insights did you gain about role coordination?  
* What are ways to create better alignment on your real projects?
