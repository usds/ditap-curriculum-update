# Class Exercise: PWS or SOO? Choosing the Right Agile Contracting Approach

Exercise Instructions:  
Work as an acquisition team to evaluate the same fictional ESA (Emotional Support Animal) project scenario. Based on what you learn, decide whether your agency should pursue a Performance Work Statement (PWS) or a Statement of Objectives (SOO) and justify your choice using discovery-informed decision criteria.

**Here's what you'll do:**

1. **Form teams** and assign a name to each one.  
2. Your team will receive one ESA project scenario and a [Delivery Sprint Report](?tab=t.ob5aw6cmmmch).  
3. As a team, discuss the **Decision Questions** below to evaluate the project environment.  
4. Decide which contracting approach is more appropriate: **PWS or SOO.**  
5. Draft a brief justification for your recommendation.

**Your Team’s Deliverable**

Submit a short written summary that includes:

* **Your Recommendation**: PWS or SOO  
* **Your Rationale**: 1–2 sentences per decision question  
* **Risk Consideration**: One key risk of your chosen approach and how your team would mitigate it  
* Prepare to share a summary of your decision and reasoning in a class debrief.

### 

**Scenarios (You will be assigned one of these scenarios.)**

**Scenario 1: Early-Stage Uncertainty**

* Users are confused by unofficial ESA sites, as trust and fraud concerns arise.  
* Accessibility is a significant issue for elderly and non-English-speaking users.  
* Internal systems are unclear; integration may be needed, but IT support is limited.  
* A motivated Product Owner is available; however, a full-time agile team is not yet in place.  
* No prototype exists yet, but user research and journey maps are complete.  
* Leadership wants quick wins but hopes to avoid public failure.

**Scenario 2: Prototype in Hand, Deadline Pressure**

* A working prototype exists and has been user tested.  
* Internal systems are well-documented, and integration points are clearly defined.  
* A full-time Product Owner and experienced COR are available.  
* Cloud hosting and DevSecOps have been approved.  
* Design and content teams are already supporting other digital efforts.  
* Accessibility, translation, and analytics requirements are clearly defined.  
* The agency must launch within 90 days.

**Scenario 3: Moderate Readiness, Some Gaps**

* User research and low-fidelity wireframes are complete; however, a tested prototype has not been created yet.  
* Legacy system documentation is partial; integration needs further exploration.  
* A part-time Product Owner is available; the COR is shared across projects.  
* IT is supportive, but it needs lead time to build the necessary infrastructure.  
* Accessibility and plain language goals are defined, but not yet in design.  
* Leadership supports agile but hasn’t adopted modular contracting yet.

**Decision Questions**

Use these to guide your team discussion:

* Do we clearly understand the user problem and the best solution?  
* Can we describe how the work should be done—or just what success looks like?  
* Do we have a dedicated Product Owner and COR ready to support agile collaboration?  
* Are we open to vendor-driven innovation, or do we need tight control?  
* Do we plan to iterate (modular/phased delivery), or deliver all at once?

**Group Discussion Prompts**

After deciding and drafting your recommendation, take a few minutes to discuss the following questions with your group. Be prepared to share one key insight with the class.

* What tipped your team toward PWS or SOO?  
* Does your scenario support successful agile delivery?  
* If you could change one factor in the scenario, would it change your recommendation?  
* How might your choice affect vendor creativity or delivery speed?

**This is what an actual output of an SOO or PWS would look like:**
