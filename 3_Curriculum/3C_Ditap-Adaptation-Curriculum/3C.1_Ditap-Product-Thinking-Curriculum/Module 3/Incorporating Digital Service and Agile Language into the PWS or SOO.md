# Incorporating Digital Service and Agile Language into the PWS or SOO
Traditional government contracts often focus on detailed requirements and rigid deliverables, but successful digital service projects require more than that. To ensure vendors deliver modern, user-centered, and adaptable solutions, we must communicate not just what we need but also how we expect the work to be done. Adding digital service language, such as working principles, human-centered design expectations, and iterative delivery practice, sets the tone for collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. These elements help align vendors with agency values, reduce misinterpretation, and create a shared understanding of what successful delivery looks like in a digital environment.

**How does this apply to an SOO?**

Some “how” is appropriate in an SOO when it’s about expectations for process, not prescriptions for execution. In other words:
- A SOO should avoid telling vendors how to build the solution (e.g., “use React” or “conduct three usability tests per sprint”).
- However, a SOO can and should express expectations for the way of working, such as being iterative, user-centered, accessible, and transparent.
- These are working principles, not technical specifications. Including them provides vendors with a framework for aligning with the agency's values and delivery standards, *without* locking them into a specific approach.

## Incorporating Digital Service Elements into the PWS or SOO
**1\. Decide Whether to Use a PWS or SOO First**
- **SOO**: Include digital expectations as *guiding principles and desired outcomes*, not prescribed tasks.
- **PWS**: Include digital expectations as *explicit tasks, deliverables, and standards*.

**2\. Where to Include These Elements**

| Section of Document | What to Include | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Background / Purpose** | Context for user-centered, iterative delivery | Reference to failed legacy systems or discovery insights |
| **Objectives (SOO)** | High-level digital service goals | “Improve access using user-centered design” |
| **Scope (PWS)** | Specific methods and expectations | “Conduct usability testing before MVP release.” |
| **Performance Requirements** | Digital service tasks, standards, and KPIs | “Deploy code daily,” “508-compliant UI” |
| **Deliverables** | Agile artifacts or research outputs | Sprint plans, research summaries, UX reports |
| **Applicable Docs** | Reference standards and policies | USDS Playbook, Agile Manifesto, USWDS, M-16-21 |

**3\. How to Phrase Expectations**</br>
For a SOO (outcome-oriented):
- “The Contractor shall design a solution using user-centered principles that meet the needs of \[target population\].”
- “The solution should be developed iteratively, with continuous user testing and public feedback.”

For a PWS (task-oriented):
- “Conduct generative user research and usability testing every sprint.”
- “Document and maintain a living product roadmap that includes KPIs aligned with user needs.”

**4\. DO's and DON'Ts**

| DO | DON'T |
| :---- | :---- |
| Reference existing playbooks, laws, and digital standards | Assume the vendor will know what “agile” means |
| Define expectations for collaboration and artifacts | Write vague instructions like “be user-friendly” |
| Specify the inclusion of accessibility, security, and plain language | Rely solely on technical specs to guide design decisions |
| Allow vendor flexibility in *how* they meet objectives (in SOO) | Dictate tool choices or specific UI patterns in an SOO |

**📄 Read: [Artifact 4 – Digital Service Language](?tab=t.jy08qufgclg0)**

As you prepare to shape or support a digital service procurement, it's essential to know what modern, user-centered scope language looks like. This example document, **Artifact 4: Digital Service Language**, provides real language you can adapt or reference when helping develop a Statement of Objectives (SOO), Performance Work Statement (PWS), or evaluation criteria.

It includes examples related to:
- Agile and human-centered delivery expectations  
- Accessibility and mobile optimization  
- Open source, security, and continuous integration  
- Human-centered design and user research  
- Product planning, backlog management, and sprint execution
