# Early and Open Vendor Engagement

To drive modernization and deliver high-performing digital services, early and transparent engagement with industry is essential. Done right, it fosters competition, innovation, and trust while helping agencies reduce risk, clarify needs, and improve acquisition outcomes. 

## Strategic Best Practices for Government Leaders

Senior leaders must lead this culture shift by modeling openness, accountability, and stewardship of taxpayer dollars. 

**Normalize market research as a strategic function.**

* Make early vendor engagement a routine, not a reactive process. Signal to teams that engaging the market before shaping a requirement isn’t a compliance hurdle but a strategic asset.  
* Direct acquisition and program staff to conduct discovery sprints or capability conversations before defining procurement strategies.

**Set a tone of transparency and equal access.**

* Use public channels ([SAM.gov](http://SAM.gov), GitHub, agency blogs) to share problem statements, draft RFIs, or acquisition forecasts. This enables broader, more diverse participation, especially from small businesses and non-traditional vendors.  
* Avoid signaling a preference for incumbents or familiar vendors.

**Prioritize problem-centric dialogues, not solutions lock-in.**

* Frame industry days, listening sessions, and RFIs around the project problem, not the presumed solution. This invites innovation and helps refine your understanding of what the market can realistically deliver.

**Empower teams to share and listen.**

* Encourage contracting and technical teams to be transparent about constraints, goals, and uncertainties. This fosters vendor trust and enables the creation of more tailored, high-value proposals.  
* Make space for two-way dialogue and “ask-me-anything” formats, not just presentations.

**Use lightweight, inclusive engagement formats.**

* Sponsor reverse industry days, open Q\&A boards, office hours, or interactive online tools to gather ideas from a broad vendor base. These formats lower the barrier to entry and surface new players.

**Make early engagement part of performance management.**

* Incentivize acquisition teams to document and reflect on vendor input and its impact on the procurement strategy. This creates a feedback loop that enhances results and supports audit readiness. 

**Lead from the front.**

* When senior officials attend early vendor engagements, it signals a strong organizational commitment. It helps reinforce the importance of innovation, accountability, and vendor diversity.

Early and open vendor engagement isn’t a procurement formality; it’s a leadership strategy. It expands the field of ideas, improves your risk posture, and drives better digital services for the public. Make it part of your agency’s culture, not just the acquisition playbook. 

## Vendor Engagement Best Practices for Government Leaders

**Creating psychological safety for innovation:**

1. **Establish clear ground rules**  
   * All information shared is non-binding and preliminary  
   * No commitments or preferences will be indicated  
   * All vendors have equal access to information and opportunities  
   * The government maintains the right to modify or cancel plans  
2. **Encourage honest feedback**  
   * Ask vendors to challenge assumptions about requirements  
   * Request feedback on the acquisition strategy and timeline  
   * Invite suggestions for alternative approaches  
   * Create safe spaces for dissenting opinions  
3. **Demonstrate genuine interest**  
   * Senior leaders should personally attend key engagements  
   * Ask substantive questions that show deep understanding  
   * Follow up on vendor suggestions and explain decisions  
   * Share how vendor input influenced final requirements

## Questions for Effective Vendor Engagement:

For problem understanding:

* "What are we missing in our problem statement?"  
* "What similar challenges have you solved, and what did you learn?"  
* "What would you do differently if you were in our position?"

For solution validation:

* "What's the biggest risk you see in our current approach?"  
* "What alternative approaches should we consider?"  
* "How would you measure success differently than we've proposed?"

For a market reality check:

* "Is our timeline realistic given the scope of work?"  
* "Are our evaluation criteria aligned with actual delivery capabilities?"  
* "What would make this opportunity more attractive to diverse vendors?"

## The Critical Importance of Empowered Product Managers

Your digital transformation will fail without empowered government Product Managers who can make real-time decisions about priorities, requirements, and vendor direction. This isn't just a nice-to-have—it's the most critical factor in the success of vendor relationships.

### Why product managers are mission-critical

**Traditional project management vs. product management**

* **Project managers** focus on delivering the predetermined scope on time and on budget  
* **Product managers** focus on discovering and providing maximum user value within constraints  
* **Project managers** succeed by following plans and managing compliance  
* **Product managers** succeed by adapting plans based on learning and user feedback

Digital services require product management because user needs evolve faster than traditional project planning can accommodate.

**The empowerment problem**

Most government organizations have "product managers" who lack the authority to make actual product decisions. They become coordinators and communicators rather than decision-makers. This creates several critical problems:

**Vendor confusion and inefficiency**

* Vendors receive conflicting directions from multiple stakeholders  
* Simple decisions require numerous meetings and approval cycles  
* Teams cannot respond quickly to user feedback or changing requirements  
* Bureaucratic decision-making processes stifle innovation

**User needs get lost**

* Stakeholder preferences override user research findings.  
* Political considerations influence product decisions more than user outcomes  
* Complex approval processes delay responses to urgent user needs  
* Product direction becomes a compromise between organizational interests rather than user-focused

**Project scope creep and failure**

* Without clear product ownership, the scope expands to satisfy multiple stakeholders.  
* Teams build features that serve organizational politics rather than user needs  
* Quality suffers because no one has the authority to make trade-off decisions  
* Projects fail because they try to serve everyone instead of delighting users

### What true product manager empowerment looks like

**Decision-making authority**

* Can prioritize features and requirements based on user research and business value  
* Authority to say "no" to stakeholder requests that don't serve users  
* Can make trade-off decisions between scope, timeline, and quality  
* Empowered to change direction based on user feedback and learning

**Resource control**

* Influence over budget allocation for development priorities  
* Authority to direct vendor work within contractual parameters  
* Can allocate team time and attention to the highest-value activities  
* Control over user research and testing resources

**Stakeholder management**

* Direct access to users and decision-makers without multiple approval layers  
* Authority to represent user needs in organizational decision-making  
* Can push back on stakeholder demands that conflict with user outcomes  
* Serves as the single point of accountability for product success

**Vendor relationship management**

* Day-to-day direction of vendor teams within strategic parameters  
* Authority to accept or reject vendor recommendations based on user value  
* Can modify tactical approaches without requiring contract amendments  
* Manages vendor performance against outcome metrics, not just deliverable completion

## Building Product Management Capability

**Hiring and development strategy**

* Recruit product managers with digital services experience, not just government experience  
* Provide training in user research, data analysis, and agile product management.  
* Create career development paths that retain talented product managers  
* Build communities of practice for sharing product management learning

**Organizational structure changes**

* Create reporting structures that give product managers appropriate authorit.y  
* Modify approval processes to support rapid product decision-making  
* Establish clear boundaries between product decisions and policy decisions  
* Build stakeholder understanding of the product manager role and authority

**Performance management alignment**

* Measure product managers based on user outcomes, not process compliance  
* Create incentive structures that reward user-focused decision-making  
* Protect product managers from criticism when they make user-centered choices that challenge organizational preferences  
* Celebrate product management successes and share lessons learned

## Executive Actions to Empower Product Managers

**Immediate actions**

* Clearly define the product manager's authority and decision-making scope  
* Communicate the product manager role and empowerment to all stakeholders  
* Provide air cover when product managers make unpopular but user-centered decisions

**Organizational changes**

* Modify governance processes to support product manager decision-making  
* Create budget structures that give product managers resource allocation authority  
* Build stakeholder management processes that channel requests through product managers  
* Establish user research capabilities that inform product managers' decisions

**Long-term capability building**

* Invest in product management training and development  
* Create product manager career advancement opportunities  
* Build organizational understanding of product management value  
* Develop internal product management expertise and best practices
