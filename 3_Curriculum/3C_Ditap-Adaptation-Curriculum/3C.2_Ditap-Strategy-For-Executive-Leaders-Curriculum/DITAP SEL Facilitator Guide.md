## DITAP Strategy for Executive Leaders (SEL) Facilitator Guide
We've broken down the DITAP Strategy for Executive Leaders into five modules, each with its own specific module folder. Each module folder contains the required information to meet the module objectives, including objectives, content, and interactive activities. We've provided a simplified learning module outline for each module. 

## Learning Modules Folders:
Your learning modules are the curriculum for the course. Each module folder contains the topic curricula, targeted case study activities, and a case study facilitator guide for each module. Your agency determines the best way to deliver this information, whether via slide decks, in-person delivery, or virtual classroom delivery. The curriculum, paired with the included strategic vision development, helps leaders understand how digital acquisition fits into their agency’s broader modernization picture and mission. 

## Learning Module Outline:
This provides you with a centralized location for all your module needs. You can use this document as a course syllabus or to set the course expectations. If the course is delivered asynchronously, this outline provides a centralized location to link the course curriculum and activities for participants. 

- **Module Objectives**:
    - These are the high-level objectives for each module. You can add your agency’s objectives in each module as you work through the material; however, these core objectives should be achieved by participants by the end of each module. 
- **Required topics**:
    - Each module has a list of required topics. The curriculum for each topic is a separate file in the module folder. It's possible to incorporate your agency's topics and content as you deliver the curriculum; however, these required topics should be covered within each module. 
- **Project RAINBO case study activities**:
    - Each module features interactive activities, based on the Project RAINBO case study, designed to reinforce its learning objectives. These activities align with the module's curriculum and provide hands-on, real-world applications of the material taught. The activities include delivery instructions, guided questions, conversation starters, knowledge checks, and answer keys, where applicable.
