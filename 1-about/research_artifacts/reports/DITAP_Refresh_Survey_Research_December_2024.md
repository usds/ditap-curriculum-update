# DITAP Refresh Survey Research - December 2024

Last modified: December 3, 2024


## Background 

The Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP) has been crucial in transforming federal procurement practices for digital services delivery. Since its creation in 2014, we have observed that the base curriculum hasn't kept pace with changes in the procurement landscape. Our goal for the DITAP Refresh project is to reimagine the curriculum to provide more experiential learning across different learner communities, make structural investments into a multiple vendor, open-source learning models that can stay agile and responsive to change, and update the curriculum to be current and future-proof. 

## Research information 

For our research, we have created a SurveyMonkey survey that asks 12 questions. Using questions we have asked previously in surveys in conjunction with synthesized results of those surveys, these questions range from general satisfaction questions to rating learning modalities, to open-ended responses where users can provide personal feedback, comments, and suggestions. We also included two questions about Workstream 2. Our final question asks responders to provide their name and email address if they'd like to participate in a follow-up interview.

### Research goals 

We are using a SurveyMonkey survey to validate our assumptions about what needs to be refreshed and what could be refreshed as we start working on updating the curriculum. The questions we're asking  around currency, applicability, cognitive load, and learning modalities will help us determine the general user sentiment on the current curriculum. This research will provide the data and knowledge needed to create a DITAP refresh roadmap.

### Survey questions 

1. I feel the DITAP curriculum content is current for today's procurement process. (Rating strongly agree - strongly disagree) *required
2. I can explain how I've applied the curriculum content to the current digital acquisition process. (Rating strongly agree - strongly disagree) *required
3. In my opinion, the amount of information presented in each release was... (rating from just the right amount to not enough with an "other" option) *required
4. The length of the course was appropriate for the amount of information provided. (Rating strongly agree - strongly disagree) *required
5. Please rate how successfully the DITAP curriculum prepared you for each of the following: (Rating from very successfully to not at all successfully) *required
6. How effective were each of these learning methods for you? (Rating very effective to very ineffective)
7. Which elements of the course did you find useful to you as a working professional? (open-ended)
8. What could be the biggest improvement to the current DITAP course curriculum? (open-ended)
9. Would you benefit from a DITAP alumni network where you could continue to engage with your peers, instructors, and course content? (Yes/no with an "other" option)
10. Would you be interested in participating in a DITAP alumni network? (Yes/no/maybe)
11. Are there additional comments or suggestions you'd like to share with us? (open-ended)
12. Are you willing to participate in a brief 20-minute interview with a member of our team? Please enter you name and email address if you are. (open-ended)

### Hypothesis 

We imagine the research will validate the following assumptions:

- The curriculum content contains outdated information
- The current curriculum could benefit from the addition of different learning modality activities
- Former DITAP participants agree that the course is beneficial in their role
- Alumni will request more examples of the application of the DITAP skills
- We can gauge if there's interest in a DITAP alumni program

### Method

Former DITAP participants will receive an email with a link to the SurveyMonkey survey. The survey is anonymous, but there is an open-ended question at the end where participants can share their name and email to participate in a follow-up interview via Zoom. While these interviews are an extension of this survey, they will be treated as a separate research effort and have a separate research plan. The current listserv for former DITAP participants is 775. We are hoping for at least 10% participation in the survey.

### Recruitment 

Participants were notified via a DITAP alumni listserv. Jeff Auser emailed the survey request to listserv recipients on Tuesday, November 26. A reminder email was sent out on Monday, December 2, and the due date for the survey collection is Friday, December 6.

### Timeline 

The survey is open from Tuesday, November 26 to Friday, December 6.
