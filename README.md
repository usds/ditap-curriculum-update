# Digital IT Acquisition Professional (DITAP) 

## Transforming Federal Digital Acquisition

The Digital IT Acquisition Professional (DITAP) program represents a fundamental shift in how the federal government approaches technology procurement. As digital transformation accelerates across agencies, acquisition professionals need modern skills, agile methodologies, and user-centered approaches to effectively purchase and manage technology solutions that serve the American people.

## Vision

The [Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training Program (DITAP)](https://techfarhub.usds.gov/get-started/ditap/) is an open-source learning model that makes DITAP scalable, adaptable, and future-proof. DITAP empowers acquisition professionals to move beyond traditional contracting methods and embrace practices that deliver better outcomes for procurement in a digital-first government.

The USDS initiated a comprehensive curriculum update to transform DITAP into a more scalable and adaptable training program. The USDS awarded a contract to audit, modernize, and update the Digital IT Acquisition Professional Training Program (DITAP). [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) led the project, with support from [TandemGov](https://www.tandemgov.com) and [Experience Institute (Ei)](https://expinstitute.com/). USDS served as the Program Owner. This refresh modernized the program by auditing and updating its content, resources, and assessment methods. With significant updates to its technological and applied learning approach, along with improved accessibility, the curriculum better reflects current procurement practices. 

### Impact Statements

* Empower procurement professionals through experiential learning and community building.  
* Enabling the government to be a better buyer of digital services.  
* Deliver improved digital outcomes that keep pace with innovation and emerging technologies.

## DITAP Consortium 

The Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP) Consortium was established to guide continuous improvement for the DITAP program, and foster a collaborative environment for DITAP program stakeholders, training providers, agencies, and alumni. The consortium will serve as a venue for participants to share regular feedback on opportunities to improve the program and course curriculum, to determine pathways to implement program changes or updates over time, and in doing so, to ultimately improve digital service procurement outcomes for the organizations DITAP graduates serve.

## Repository Purpose

This repository hosts the DITAP curriculum. It provides all the resources needed for vendors and partners to deliver the program with fidelity while allowing flexibility in specific components. The open-source approach ensures transparency, enables continuous improvement, and allows the broader acquisition community to benefit from these modern practices.

The repository is designed to keep content **continuously updated**. Updates ensure the curriculum reflects evolving digital acquisition practices, emerging technologies, and feedback from the field. This makes the program a living resource that adapts with the needs of the federal procurement community.

In addition, the repository is a **collaborative space**. Current DITAP providers, agency stakeholders, and members of the broader community are invited to contribute to the curriculum. Contributions, through pull requests and issue reporting, ensure the program evolves with real-world needs.

## Repository Structure

We organized our repository to support efficient knowledge-sharing, curriculum delivery, and maintenance:

### **/1\_About**

Contains background information on the DITAP program, guidelines for contributing (including how to submit pull requests), and information on governance and support. 

### **/2\_Consortium**

Holds consortium meeting notes, the charter, and related documentation to demonstrate how DITAP Consortium contributes to the program sustainability. 

### **/3\_Curriculum**

Includes the standardized core curriculum, two adaptation curricula, and a suite of supporting materials (e.g., facilitator guides, slides, learner resources) to help vendors deliver the program effectively.

## Updates & Versioning

This curriculum is developed and hosted in GitHub using LiaScript, supporting a flexible, collaborative workflow with rapid updates and version control. To utilize these materials, you can download them directly or clone the repository to your local environment. Detailed instructions and technical setup guidance are available under /3A\_Vendor-Materials.

Curriculum updates are released periodically to incorporate feedback and reflect evolving digital acquisition practices. Curriculum updates are released periodically to integrate input and reflect evolving digital acquisition practices. Vendors should check for the most recent materials before each program delivery and can subscribe to repository notifications to stay informed of updates.
